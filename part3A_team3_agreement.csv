1_2_1,tomer,"so basically i was in my dad's small business store selling business supplies.

our clients are typically small - mid sized businesses and we typically deal with just one purchaser or owner on one end and we have a friendly relationship with our customers. 

so we have this one client [fairly new], who talks alot. she seems really nice and is plenty satisfied with the purchases/prices. 

so anyone, one day she comes into the store [this is random, because we usually just ship it to them].

at this point, my dad is manning the register while i am stocking up the shelves. 

and she tells us about a ""business"" in which you log on to a website, do nothing of note for a few mins each day, provide your personal details, and basically you collect points and you will be rewarded based upon the points. apparently she had been doing this for a month+ now and just needed to log on for another month before collecting a huge reward.

she was going to link us up where we sign up which will give her a bonus 100 points. my dad stated that this was interesting and she should send us a link. 

at this point i blurted out that this was a scam. 

she looked at me like i had engaged in ethnic cleansing, and then starts arguing with me, at which point i state the obvious facts, and why this is clearly a scam, all the while my dad is motioning for me to shut up. 

this discussion continues for around 3-4 minutes by the end of which she started screaming about how we can't recognize a good business opportunity and all our supplies dont work and we lie about the products and what not. 

all the while there is a guy coming into the door who hears everything, and leaves. she also leaves and we have yet to receive an order from that company since. also, she was a referral by another owner who i assume is not going to be pleased about this.",4,3. Moderately guilty,4
3_2_1,tomer,"so this story starts a few weeks ago... this super attractive guy (let's call him mark), and i started talking. ya know, casual stuff. not much going on. one night, i got drunk and started texting him that i thought he was attractive. ever since then, he started talking to me more and more. slowly, the conversation got more and more... 'interesting.' 

he started telling me how much he wanted me, and we started making plans to see each other. a few nights ago, he picks me up from my house in a ford explorer and we drive out onto a backroad. we climb in the back, and the clothes come off. we're making out, feeling each other up. 

i'll add that i recently got out of a long term relationship, and this was my first encounter with a guy since the breakup. i was looking forward to blowing off some steam. i was a lioness on the prowl for some meat. 

after minimal foreplay, i start to ride him. easy pace, nothing too intense. got to have room to grow, ya know? not even 20 seconds in, his eyes get wide and he looks at me.

""uhm, i think you should stop.""

i look at him, seriously confused and very disappointed. was i really that terrible? i just sit there on top of him for another 2 seconds, trying to figure out what's going on. he looks at me again...

""uh... i'm finished...""

he fucking came after 20 seconds. and he didn't even bother to help me finish afterwards. i'm pissed, i really had pent up emotions to get rid of.

we stop, put our clothes on, and he silently drives me home. tells me goodnight, i get out of the truck, and walk back into my house. 

and to make matters worse? he still hasn't texted me many days later. fuck. i'm disappointed.",4,2. Slightly guilty,2
4_2_1,tomer,"so this is currently happening as we speak.


my girlfriend is freaking out at me right now because i changed my relationship status on facebook to single. yesterday she pretty much dumped me saying she can't do this anymore because she is stressed out over going to college and leaving our city. she doesn't think she can do long distance. plus some stuff about her ex and whatnot. the relationship was coming to an end anyways. but it seemed like a nice soft break up with no hard feelings, so i was okay.


my fuck up was assuming that she dumped me when she really meant she needs time to think if it really is over between us. so i ended up changing my relationship status on facebook after seeing on hers that it said ""no relationship information"". she is now freaking out, saying ""i'd never dump someone over text, thanks for thinking so highly of me"".


now she said she doesn't want to do this right now and needs some space while she breaks down.",1,2. Slightly guilty,1
5_2_1,tomer,"this actually happened a few months ago.

i used to be in a long-distance relationship. i would only see my now-ex girlfriend in person every few months so, when we were able to be together in person, we would take advantage of the situation, so to speak...

she was visiting me and we were, as always, planning to have sex (i'll just be blunt about it.) we're seniors in high school so, of course, i live with my parents and plans have to be made accordingly to conceal our activities (my mother had told me explicitly not to have sex with my girlfriend.) and we were fairly good at this. but there was a problem. she was out of birth control pills.

we had her prescription transferred to my local walmart from hers and picked it up. no big deal. we then went about our activities unencumbered .

after my girlfriend went home my mother showed me a piece of paper one day and asked ""does [insert girlfriend name here] need this?"" in a suspicious tone. to my horror it was the receipt for her birth control pills. we left it in the car. actually, i left it in the car. this isn't today we fucked up. it's today i fucked up. i made up some bullshit excuse for her needing them because she was on her period. but my mother, being a woman, saw through the facade.",1,4. Very guilty,1
8_2_1,tomer,"i was helping my girlfriend prepare a nice jalapeno cheese dip to bring to a family gathering. we did it all from scratch, complete with picking out the best jalapenos and chopping them up. i was preparing different portions of the dish while she chopped them up.

after making the dip and rigorously washing our hands, we went to play some video games. about 30 minutes later, she was holding the eye of sauron. the most intense burning set in and we were desperate. ice, milk, aloe - all the fixes were temporary relief and nothing alleviated the burn. i had heard cum had the benefit of providing relief and suggested it. she is a trooper and was desperate for a relief, so she allowed me to cum on her hands. it actually worked! or maybe it was mental...

que about 30 minutes later, her lips are burning (she likely touched them later in the chopping process). again, i offered up my services, and for the first time in our relationship, i delivered cool frosting relief direct to her face.

while it did alleviate her burn (though she said it was the most disgusting thing she had ever done), i wasn't as careful this time and picked up some of the oils.

i had never had a jalapeno burn before, but experiencing it on tiny tim has to be the worst way to go. unfortunately, weapon of ass destruction was already deployed twice the in proceeding hour, thus had none left to offer. i then proceeded to kneel before the tub faucet for the next hour running cool water, which she thought was the perfect time to immortalize on her phone forever.",3,4.

9_2_1,tomer,"as with many of these post it did not happen today but a few weeks ago. my wife and i recently had a baby so for the first few weeks the sleep arrangements were a bit rocky. about the 3rd night that the kid was home from the hospital i took the night shift so that my wife could get 4 or 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep. around 5 am she got up to relive me and i went to sleep in the spare bedroom. upon waking up i really needed to shit. now i sleep in the nude and have no problem walking around my house in the buff. the wife doesn't really care and the animals don't seem to give a shit either. so i clenched my cheeks and did the i have to shit shuffle up to the bathroom. the door was shut so i knocked and said "" lifesahoot's wife i need to use the bathroom"". the reply i got was "" be right out"". to which i said ""hurry up i really need to shit"". i hear some shuffling around, a toilet flush and the door open. the only problem was that my mother-in-law walks out of the bathroom, not my wife. she see's me standing there bare assed naked, giggles some apology and runs around the corner. up to this point in my relationship i had no idea how much my wife and my mother-in-law sound alike.",4,2. Slightly guilty,2
10_2_1,tomer,"this happened this sunday. 

my family had a late christmas at one of my uncles place. think my grandmother, her 4 kids and a notable amount of grandchildren. small precision : said uncle is quite the nerd, and very gay. he's in a long term relationship, white picket fence, dog and all jazz. nobody bats an eye about it.

the meal goes well and everyone starts to migrate to the living room to digest the unholy amount of poultry we just ate.
my uncle go himself a shield tv and a big ass nas for christmas. the whole thing is perfectly configured with this media center app called kodi. this sweet piece of software allows you to access your music/movies/pictures with a nice slicky interface. 

despite being more than 80, granny is actually quite interested by high tech stuff (especially when it's related to the tv) and she asks me to show her what it does. after a few minutes demonstrating things like netflix and games i show her kodi, and then let her play with the app, navigating movies and whatnot. i then got to the other side of the room to get a drink when when the tv starts blasting gay porn loudly. to add insult to injury, this is not a regular porn but a nice homemade video of my uncle, his boyfriend and another couple. it only took a few seconds to shut down the but the mood was quite ackward for the rest of the day. 

thanksfully my uncle doesn't hate me too much, he admited himself that adding all the nas videos in bulk was not his best idea.",1,2. Slightly guilty,1
11_2_1,tomer,"so this happenend roughly 24 hrs ago. my family and i were having a small get togather to make tamales and drink. later in the evening my sisters boyfriend, who drags my sister everywhere, was leaving and trying to make her go with him. i hadnt hung out with my siblings all togather like that in a few years due to being overseas, so i wasnt haven it. i stopped it from happening ""got in his face"" and ate a quick left hook to the jaw. that started a huge conflict that brung up almost decade old demons resulting in a 8 year relationship falling apart. after the dust settles and the guest left my 1800 camera was no where to be found. the worse part is that the only real culprit was someone close. what a great start to 2018",4,3. Moderately guilty,4
12_2_1,tomer,"so i started college this year and went with a random roommate instead of finding someone on facebook. we didn't talk much over the summer, but we got along pretty well when we met on the first day of orientation. as the semester went along, we became really close and really good friends. he's probably the best friend i've made at school. we're just really compatible and we offer a lot to each other. 

because of this, i've developed a bit of a crush on him. he's super nice and selfless, and not terrible looking. he came out to me about a month ago, telling me he thinks he's gay and asking advice, and that only strengthened my desires for him. 

it's now winter break and i haven't seen him in a week. we've kept in casual conversation, nothing too heavy. i've told my home friends of my feelings for him, so the other day i snapchatted a picture of his facebook profile picture to a few friends with the caption ""how could you not fall for this cutie?""

i accidentally sent it to my roommate as well. 

i quickly realized my mistake and proceeded to attempt to cover my ass by sending him more snapchats, zooming in on his face and saying creepier things about him, finally ending with a shot of just his eyes and the caption ""he's watching you."" 

he texted me with a screenshot of all the notifications saying ""u good bro?"" ""hahahaha"" and i replied with ""yeah idek."" luckily, we're both a little eccentric and i hoped he wouldn't think twice about it. we proceeded to have a pretty serious (but short) conversation, and we've talked a few times since then. 

i still can't tell if he caught on or not. 

my biggest fear is that he'll get weirded out because i like him and live with him and that our friendship will suffer. i'm currently leaning towards not pursuing a relationship with him (because we're roommates and that might complicate things), but i'd still like to maintain the good friendship we developed.",4,2.

15_2_1,tomer,"i fingered my best friend and i think that i fucked our relationship. i am a 16 year old male and my friend is also 16.(obligatory to say that it is legal where i live)

so this girl and i are best friends and we get along great but due to two of my closest guy friends liking her and the fact that she has had bad relationships in the past we haven't even considered a relationship. 

so wednesday night we are in my room at my parents and she starts getting close and saying stuff to tease me, this ended because we had to go somewhere. after this we have a conversation about actually doing it and we both say why not. 
jump to friday night we were hanging out and she got bored so i suggest that we head to my grandmas place, which is empty because she is on vacation. well we get there and one thing leads to another and the details don't matter but stuff happens... (i almost said i love you).  i am thinking i just did this and i feel great and i keep thinking that as i drop her off. now it's time for a little background information, i have been struggling with feelings for her for a while but i have just dismissed them as puppy love because we were such good friends but now that we have done this all i want to do is fuck her and i honestly don't know what to do. the best part of this story is timing, we have finals in a couple days. we hang out in a group of three guys and two girls so i don't know how this will affect it but fuck it will be interesting when i see her again on monday.",4,2.

150_2_2,tomer,"so this happened a few minutes ago. 

a little background to the story. i live with my parents. that is all. 

so i'm laying in bed, had been browsing reddit all morning, and decided to rub one out before i got the day started. like any good son i masterbate in silence, my whereabouts unknown for approximately 9 minutes (7 minutes spent looking for a good vid). i put one headphone and one out before i got started. i find a good video and get to work. about 30 seconds before my ejaculation, i hear foot steps towards my door. they eventually stop so i get right back into the zone. i hear the foot steps again and am in mid-eruption. i tried to do that thing you do when wanting to last longer during sex, which is to squeeze the tip of my penis in hopes that my ejaculation will delay just a bit more. it didn't work. with all the pressure built up from me strangling my penis, the cum went straight for my face and i didn't have time to dodge the headshot. my mother walks in seconds after this nightmare. i am silent, with one headphone in, and cum all over my face. my roommates have never been one to intrude on my privacy. all my mother said was, ""breakfast is ready,"" and walks out. don't know if she saw what happened. i am scared to leave my room. if my dad finds out about this, he will never let me live it down.",4,3.

151_2_2,tomer,"as a long time lurker in this subreddit, i just didn't understand how everyone shits themselves all the time. i  had managed to stay poopy pants free since i  was 5 years old , so what's the big problem? on wednesday  morning i found out.


it was  my day off, so naturally i was lying naked in bed browsing reddit all morning. i had to go into town to pick up some stuff at 1 o'clock , so by 12 o'clock  it was time to go and shower and get on with my day.

then it happened.

i felt a fart coming on. all  tifu  readers know better than to trust a fart, so i slowly and carefully let it out.  halfway through, it felt like there was a turd trying to get out, so i instantly clenched.

wetness.

thinking ""fuck, i sharted"", i got up to  go to  the  toilet, only to  see the horrible truth. i hadn't been farting  but shitting  liquid diarrhea  over my bed. a good half cup of the stuff. to make it even better, i had had pork satay  for dinner the night before, so it was a radioactive  yellow colour.


eventually i got it all cleaned up, even getting the stain out of  the  mattress and washed, dried and changed the  sheets before my wife got home from work, but it wasn't the best start to  my day.",4,3. Moderately guilty,3
153_2_2,tomer,"this morning i get up for work, jump in the car and start the ignition. my engine immediately starts caterwauling. 

do you remember the messages in your facebook feed about how cats take a nap in your engine block to hide from the cold, or even heat? i found out the hard way they're true. 

a little black cat (less than a year old) jumped out from under my car. she had a loosely dangling rear leg and several skin injuries. needless to say, the poor thing was scared out of her wits, not to mention in terrible pain. 

thankfully, an old lady in the street saw me comforting that cat while i was trying to reach several vets (none of whom were in office at that time). she pointed me to where the owners lived. 

so i rang them out of bed, and passed on a couple of the phone numbers i dialed. i'll go check in a few days to see if she's doing fine. 

accidents like this may be unavoidable, but i still felt guilt and responsibility.

**update:** kitty cat didn't make it. :( 

i went by that house again last night to see what was up, but there was no good news to be told. apparently she had gotten a belly wound too. it wasn't immediately visible because it had been immediately scorched shut (and she had black fur too).

158_2_2,tomer,"so this technically happened last night, but after spending the rest of the night cleaning up and trying to fix the aftermath i only just now have time to post this.

my girlfriend and i just moved into a house we bought off foreclosure.  now, most of the house was in good condition, but there was still a lot of work to be done.  we just finished painting everything, replacing the light fixtures, and are in the middle of getting new floors.  one thing we wanted was to have our tv over the fireplace, but when our cable provider sent someone out to hook up our cable he told us he couldn't put a cable outlet there unless we drilled the hole in the attic ourselves.

so fastforward a week and my gf's father decided to go drill a hole in the attic and run a cable through the wall to a new socket he made over the fireplace.  now, he is very good at things like this, but when it comes to electrical work (or anything involving electronics) he is fairly clueless, so when he started talking about how he still needed to run the phone line through the hole for our cable box i started to wonder just what he did.  

so last night i decided to climb up there and see just what he had done.  when i climbed up there and began crossing the attic i learned that the attic wasn't completed, that most of it had only a thin layer of sheetrock between me and the room below, so i stepped carefully to avoid denting the ceiling.  well, on my way back from seeing his work, my foot slipped.  next thing i know i'm hanging from the rafters with my foot wrapped up in a now twisted light fixture.  the light fixture saved me from falling completely, but now it's bent up really badly and there is a four square foot hole in the ceiling with insulation falling out.",1,3.

159_2_2,tomer,"so i've been working on a flame effect called a fire poofer to install on some skate ramps. the basic concept is that you have a pilot light and a high-pressure regulator that allows you to shoot fireballs [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad0vjj4naba).

the whole thing is controlled by a custom-made pressure plate connected to a battery and an electric solenoid that i have been working on and i was testing the pressure plate but it was not working quite correctly, so i went back into my apartment, leaving the fire poofer outside on the corner.

after a few minutes of drilling holes to attach ramps up onto the pressure plate, i asked my friend who was helping me to go outside to check on the fire poofer. (i live in san francisco and was concerned some homeless person might walk up and try to carry it away).

after a minute or two, when my friend didn't return, i went outside to check on what was up. as soon as i walk out the door, there are 20 cops including their commanding officer (a sergeant i think) all blocking off the street. they had caution tape going in all four directions and i walked up to them and asked what was going on. 

they asked me if the fire poofer was mine and i explained that it was and they asked me what the hell i was doing. i live across the street form a hospital and apparently someone had seen the propane tank sitting on the corner connected to a battery and called the bomb squad! 

they took my id and copied down my information and asked me to explain exactly what the hell i was doing. i walked them through step by step how it all works and showed them the video on my phone linked above. 

half of the cops laughed and said it was cool and were interested, the other half were pissed off and wanted to search my apartment. in the end, they all just left and let me take my equipment back inside.

so about 10 years ago, when i was about 21, i worked at a restaurant with a woman who was probably about 45 at the time. we were talking one day and she mentions that she wasn't close with her brother any more. naturally, i asked why, to which she replied that he had died years ago. i offered my condolences and asked what happened. she goes ""he was eaten by a lion."" obviously, i laughed hysterically at her joke because this is america and not some african plain with wild lions. who the hell gets eaten by a fucking lion?

she just stared at me.

i instantly knew she wasn't making a joke and that i was the world's biggest asshole. turns out, her brother used to work at a local amusement park which used to have a mini zoo/safari thing. he went in to lion area, and was eaten by a lion. the amusement park doesn't have the zoo/safari any more for obvious reasons. man, i wish i could get that one back.

edit: for those who are curious/doubting, google ""king island lion"" and a bunch of stuff comes up.  there's a wiki article that also has a newspaper clip about it.  upon reading it, i just found out that there were apparently two lion attacks there.  one survived, the other did not.  thanks everybody!",1,4.

so i follow pakalu papito on facebook, and one of his popular quotes is ""why have abs, when you can have keb-abs?""

on the afternoon before a school dinner i'm having a kebab and am reminded of this quote, so i take a picture and caption it with the quote from pakalu. i get some likes, but i leave it alone and don't think too much about it.

fast forward to that evening at the school dinner. i see my crush of nearly 2 years is all dressed up, looking as stunning as one can get in a little black dress. now she walks up to me and asks, ""have you been working out?"" and proceeds to poke my belly, followed by ""apparently not!""

at this point i'm feeling quite astounded and hurt by this unusual greeting (i haven't seen her in a few weeks and i haven't exactly been in tip-top shape of late although i'm not really fat yet) and proceed to tell her so. her close friend, not knowing what's going on either, compliments me on something and i smile and tell her thank you, that's how it should be done, and tell her i like her hair.

my crush on the other hand, realising by now the joke has fallen flat, proceeds to hold out the most beautiful tricep and pinches the non-existent fat and says, ""oh i'm just joking, see how flabby my arm is too!""

at this point all she's managed to do is make me feel even more self-conscious. i walk back to my table and wonder what could have prompted her to say such a thing, and then i'm reminded of dear old pakalu papito. i smile to myself when i realise what's happened, and pull out my phone to check facebook, sure enough she's liked the post. but it's too late to tell her i realised.",1,2.

166_2_2,tomer,"so i discovered the weirdest pavlov's dog thing about myself today.


when i was around 13 or so i used to get erections a lot during church. i don't know why. maybe it was because all the women were dressed pretty, maybe because it was inappropriate, therefore i though of it as ""naughty"". all i knew was i got the biggest, blackest erection every sunday. 

 also what's key to this as well is that my grandpa would always have a pocketful of werther's originals to bring to church. we called it church candy. i'd always enjoy a couple of that sweet honey/caramel to pass the time while fighting off boredom sleep/debilitating erections.

today someone offered me a werther's original at work. i commented ""oh man i haven't had these since i would go to church with my grandparents!"" i was super stoked to have one after all these years.

as soon as i popped it in my mouth, i for real got a really good boner. i was laughing so hard when i ate it and couldn't tell my co-workers why. 

now this has only happened once, but i will repeat this experiment and see if i truly have discovered cheap viagra for myself.

301_2_3,tomer,"to be fair, the fuck-up wasn't entirely mine, but, as they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. also, this happened 20 minutes ago.

i'm downstairs with my family, watching tv, when the urge to urinate slowly creeps in. i go upstairs to our only bathroom and, thinking the family was preoccupied, decided there was no need to close the door. this would have been fine, if i hadn't forgotten about my four-legged family members. they regularly follow me into the bathroom without incident (they like to drink from the sink), so i thought nothing of it.

but just a couple seconds after i had my stream flowing, the 8-month old adolescent cat decided he was too lazy to jump up to the sink like he normally does. instead, he thought he would be clever and take two smaller jumps; first, onto the toilet, and then up to the sink. the whole thing happened in under a second, so i didn't have time to react. he had jumped up onto the lip of the toilet and ran across the front of it, interrupting my stream of urine. a stripe of it now ran from the back of his head, down his back, and ended near the base of his tail. he didn't flinch, and proceeded to perch himself on the counter and stare into the empty sink, waiting for me to turn on the water for him; i'm not even sure he realized what had happened. he got a bit more water than he bargained for; i immediately gave him a quick bath. fortunately, he doesn't seem to hold any hard feelings about it.",2,2.

302_2_3,tomer,"although i'm quite open to things (ears pierced and recreational drug use), my family is still conservative as expected of an asian family. all my siblings are in great universities and play at least one instrument so that gives you a bit of insight of how things are done around here.


anyway, it was saturday night and my friend picked up a fair bit of weed (3g) to split between 4 people. so we just smoke up at my friends house since his house is massive and we all end up smoking way too much and having a blast. 10 packets of chips later, i head home still sky high and like any sensible person would do, i called for my dad and my step mom but all was silent so i figured that they'd be at my stepmoms plaxe. i put porn on as soon as i got to my bedroom and started to get a boner and before i know it, my dick was getting a pounding. 

it felt so amazing, i was enjoying every bit of it. i suddenly needed some water so i went to the kitchen and had a sip of water before i returned back into my bedroom. after 10 more minutes, i was close to finishing and since i was high, i started making moaning and groaning sounds like a male pornstar, which were quite loud because i heard myself through my headphones which happen to be sound isolating beats by dre.

after the most amazing finish ever, i laid there with the cum still on my stomach and i'm relaxing even more  now. suddenly i hear a shift outside and to my absolute horror, my dad and stepmom were in their rooms. that means they came back during the duration of my private time and walked past my room where the door was half way open since i forgot to close it when i went to get the water. 

i'm absolutely sure that they heard and probably saw too because my dad is acting very detached and weird to me at the moment. my high that night dipped extremely low to the point where i felt terrible. i wanted to sink into the bed and never come back out again.",4,3. Moderately guilty,3
304_2_3,tomer,"this happened like two week before. my cousin was trying to format his computer and upgrade to windows 8 from xp. but due to hard disk problem, it didn't install anything above windows xp. so, he asked me if there was any thing that was wrong with the computer. he shared me some technical errors that appeared at the screen, which i immediately recognized as hard disk problem.

so i told him how to repair it. he didn't understand what i was saying, so i decided to demonstrate what to do. he was copying every steps that i did, so he wouldn't have a problem later on. there was this one step while solving this problem, that i had to open a program called ""diskpart"", and there is a feature named ""clean"" which completely formats the hard disk.  so, i said that you just have to type clean there (and i typed clean too) and press enter (which i was very careful not to press). he started reviewing the steps he had written to make sure everything was fine. when it was all right, i just said ""yeah!! that's it, and at last just press enter."" and i actually pressed enter at that time. i immediately realised that clean command was still typed there and my hard disk was starting to format. i removed the laptop's battery as soon as possible, and waited for sometime before keeping it in again and restarted my pc. unfortunately, all the data had been lost. it was gone beyond recovery. well, i thought it was not a big deal. but when my parents came home, they were surprised to see every documents they had on pc deleted.

they asked what happened and i told them the truth. they didn't do anything to me(fortunately) but i came to know yesterday that the laptop had my mom's only digital copy of her masters degree thesis, and my family suffered a heavy loss of around $5000 work as my father lost some valuable office documents he had prepared for around a month. i am just glad that my parents are not giving me hell right now.",4,4.

306_2_3,tomer,"first off, this is my first post on tifu and its on mobile so i'm sorry in advance for spelling errors and grammar

context: around spring break my english has to write a 6-7 page research paper on someone we think is a hero. we are finding our base source for our papers. i am a music nut and love metal bands like of mice & men and suicide silence, which makes me an outcast in my grade. we have a smart board in our class to show examples and stuff. i go to a stuck up christian school. i'm agnostic. 

the fu: i wanted to do my paper on of mice & men's screamer, austin carlile. all around great guy. loves his fans, family, and friends and has done a lot of great things for his fans such as helping me out of depression. so i tell my teacher who i want to write on and he calls me to his desk. i walk up thinking it's not going to be a big deal considering i had done a little research on him earlier that week and only news and good things came up. 

so we proceed to search him on google. big mistake. first result is his mugshot saying he was arrested on misdemeanor charges for aggravated assault ( i later learned from my sister, who is his biggest fan,
 that he was standing up for someone). the entire class proceeds to laugh at me for being such a dumbass and looking up to this guy. did i mention we have a kid doing a paper on putin on heroism??? so i turn red faced and mentally face palm as my teacher ( who is a great guy) turns off the smart board and prints me a massive article on bono. i am so embarrassed i am afraid to ever mention my music tastes again. and the icing on the cake? the band i hate the most ( behind one direction and those types of ""bands"") is u2. fuck me.",1,3.

308_2_3,tomer,"i am a cna. the patient with dementia has had horrible breath for the last few days, despite brushing teeth and mouthwash. i said that the resident might be constipated because signs of extreme constipation also include bad breath and no one was sure when they last went to the bathroom. with approval of the med tech i gave the resident prune juice.

skip forward a few hours and the head nurse calls me to tell me that the family complained and freaked out because i suggested that the resident  might be constipated.

it was a very rookie mistake. rule number one of the medical field is not to diagnose or suggest a diagnosis if you aren't a doctor.

309_2_3,tomer,"i just came back from the cinemas, with my childhood crush.
i immediately knew i fucked up, that's why i came here. 

plus she's the **first** girl i ever picked up with a car.

we had a good time. with the chinese new year festive season the movies were so packed but thankfully we got good seats. 

but that's not the point here. 

i don't have a physical memento of today. no photo. 

i don't even have the movie tickets with me. she has them .... 

first, we bought the tickets. then since we still had time before the movie starts i decided to sit down and have a chat with her. we only had like 40 minutes before the movie starts. 

after chatting so long i realized this is my chance to get a photo taken, i took out my phone, asking what phone she's currently using cause she lost her phone to robbers months ago. i thought this was my chance, but then she kept on going about how she got robbed and i can't allow myself to stop the topic as i find it is actually a sensitive matter, plus i wanted to know more too. so i lost my chance. then we had to quickly go back to the cinema and buy popcorn & drinks last minute, and proceeded into the halls.

after the movie, i was thinking: *you know what? i'll just stop in front of her house later, then take a photo together before i drop her off. okay sounds like a perfect plan.* we had to rush because she's going off to her grandma's place for dinner later and we're a little late. 

here comes the shitty part. 

we arrived in front of her doorstep.......................  holy shits her family are all outside waiting for her ! fuck this. 

i can't take a photo with all her family outside the house waiting, i'll look like a dumb fuck. seriously. 

i left the scene, **crushed inside.**

so here i am, ranting out to you guys. seeking comfort. :'( 
sigh. 

i still like her, deep down. ^cries",2,3. Moderately guilty,3
311_2_3,tomer,"tifu reddit ... i work at a small movie theatre, where every single saturday night a huge group of teenagers will come to ""see a movie."" really, these kids will buy a ticket (any ticket they can get their hands on) and spend the whole evening walking the halls, disrupting other patrons and repeatedly trying to sneak into r rated movies.


for midnight shift workers, they are a total pain. add in a movie as popular as deadpool, and they've become a right nightmare.


it's a saturday, i'm working midnight shift and i get tired of hearing doors opening and kids giggling etc. i decide to do what our rent-a-cop won't do: tell a kid off. partly to ease my boredom, partly to hopefully teach these kids a lesson. 


i walk down the hall where a gangly young teen is loitering by the bathrooms. i ask him what he's doing and he points to the women's bathroom and says, ""waiting on her.""  i assume he's talking about another teenager, so i tell him to get back to his movie. he seems hesitant, but i insist, saying that i'll wait for his friend. (i'm assuming she's also a teenager bent on causing trouble.)


he makes a beeline for deadpool, and when i ask to check his ticket to see if that's his correct movie, he says he doesn't have it. it's at this point that his mother comes out of the bathroom, to find her teenaged son crying, standing in the hall with a stern (and then confused) looking theatre worker. she turns to him, saying, ""what's wrong?"" she then asks me what he did. 


i have to explain to this woman that i assumed her teenaged (obviously emotionally or mentally delayed) son was sneaking into an r rated movie without a ticket. she understands, but by this point this poor kid is properly crying and is scared that he's in trouble and that i'm going to kick his family out of the film. 


i apologized for the misunderstanding, hating myself a little and thinking that maybe the do-nothing rent-a-cop has the right idea after all.",4,3. Moderately guilty,3
313_2_3,tomer,"this happened about two months ago, yet still affects me to this day.

my girlfriend is a freak at swimming, so being the great guy that i am, i had decided to purchase tickets to sydney to watch her swim in the nationals competition. accommodation was already provided by her family so that meant all i had to do was bring money to purchase whatever i wanted. she was only competing two days, so this meant that out of the whole week, i had about 4-5 days to relax with her and her family.

now the **fu**...
so to explain myself on how this fu even occurred, i will first off tell you all that we were all sitting on this kind of [couch](http://img2.wfrcdn.com/lf/50/hash/28885/11164289/4/innova-australia-corner-sofa-bed-with-storage-chaise-s2123b.jpg). i was lying down with my head at the end of the extended part, with my gf next to me with her feet near my head and the same with her father... being the kind of person whose hands have to be doing something all the time, they roamed until they found a foot. i started massaging it, in hopes that my girlfriend would appreciate the gesture; only to hear *""you right there mate? you have a foot fetish or something huh?""* immediately i let go, and tried to play cool by stupidly saying ""i was just giving a soldier like you a well deserved foot massage."" oh yeah, forgot to mention, her father is a soldier...",2,3.

314_2_3,tomer,"backstory : so this happened on thursday but to start off i am in high school and so i have a friend who we'll call johnathan. me and jonathan have known eachother since 2nd grade when i moved to my current city. we've done pranks on each other since i could remember and between us retaliation is mandatory. 

ok now on to the story, me and johnathan are in my robotics class and all of a sudden he came up behind me and called my name proceeding to slap this sensitive patch of skin right where the back of the neck and you back meet. i got like some type of skin condition so this hurt like some holy buttered biscuits man. i turned around and he put this arms on my shoulders cause he knew i would hit him back but out of no where after playing ufc 2 non stop and having some friendly spars with another friend i doubled johnathan over and knee him right in family jewels fam. immediately i felt a wave of pain so big kelly slater wouldn't ride, he uppercut that shit.
 
of course the teacher saw this all and she doesn't like rough housing or any thing like that and while i'm taking huge breaths i get her mandatory ""iamthefreshprince, you know i don't like to see that behavior, get your stuff."" well shit i know what that means in my school, some 7 ft security will come and pick you up and take you to the office and 99% of the time result in in school suspension or normal suspension.
 
johnathan is getting the same speech while doubled over in the fetal position. to no surprise the dreaded security came and escorted us. awkward phone call home ensues (strict mexican parents were relieved that it was a call and not suspension) and a weird talk explaining to the principal and my parents as to why i kneed my friend in the dick.",3,3.
