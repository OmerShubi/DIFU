457,Tamir,"this happened in the middle of november, i'm a 17 year old guy that got a job at a fast food joint back in may. at night there is only 2 people on shift so depending on who im working with the conversation  between us could be innocent or not. the female i enjoy the company of most would be my 28 year old chubby dark haired pale skinned co worker, we will call her ""big butt"" or ""bb"".  bb loved how i flirted with her, and after only a few weeks we were having sex on a regular basis. we kept our physical relationship secret from our coworkers so as to avoid unnecessary gossip.

  at some point in november is when the fuck up happened, after work one night me and bb ride back to her place, get intimate, and then realize i cant find any condoms. normally i have a box with me but on that specific night i had misplaced it and the passion was already getting thick. i said i would just pull out of her but bb insisted she had condoms laying around. out from the bottom drawer of her bathroom sink she pulls out a couple dusty lifestyle rubbers that look like they have been there for years. 

  fast forward about 30 minutes and i'm pulling myself out of her snatch noticing how the condom completely tore in half and now my sperm is gushing out of her pussy as well. 

4 weeks later and her period never came, and another 2 weeks after that bb learned from her doctor she is pregnant. i still have not told my parents about this nor do i know how to tell them.

464,Tamir,"let me start out by saying, i'm a 28 year old male. i'm balding just slightly, quite successful, but the only thing that looks good on my body anymore is my face. i tend to have a gravitational pull on friendships with the other sex often, and i attribute it to my flirtatious attitude and kind demeanor. 

so this evening, yes this very one, i was offered sex in a curious fashion. i am married, and i have never really been put in a situation like this. the lady that offered was a close friend of mine. she has an amazing personality and i didn't even realize what she was doing. she and i were talking about her most recent relationship and she went into a conversation about desiring a fwb. what i didn't realize is that she was referring to me. as a married man, i have never had this problem, or had someone even approach the topic like that. i drove home only to receive a txt stating that her offer was obviously declined. apparently my ""i need to get fucked"" radar has stopped working. or perhaps what little morals i have left are finally playing a role in my life.",1. Not guilty
477,Tamir,"this happened last (saturday) night.

my bf was sleeping over as per usual, but this night we ended up having a long serious conversation about our relationship. after things cooled down, we started getting frisky and one thing lead to another...

the sex hadn't worked out as expected because he started feeling sharp pains, so i wanted to finish it off with a quick handy/head. i told him to start it by whacking himself off. everything we did was in the dark, so when i felt splatters of liquid i assumed it to be his precum and ignored it. when he got close i started going at it, and i completely dismissed the fact that it tasted a little odd..
after we finished up and went  to wash up, the light revealed smears of blood all over our bodies and spots of blood on the bed. at first we thought it might have been from me, but upon further inspection we realized he'd torn his foreskin (frenulum) and his ejaculate was actually blood. needless to say, he went into total shock and we spent a good chunk of our morning at the clinic.

479,Tamir,"this happened today immediately before posting this, my first thought was to tell me fellow redittors about my fuck up.

the story starts with me dating this girl for about a year. we met during a work conference and have tons of common coworkers, but we had to keep everything on the dl since we work together. everything was great and i began to fall for her, even as we have discussed to keep it simple. we even ended up going to weddings out of state together and spent weekends with parents, whatever. 

shortly after she had moved away for work, i broke it off. i was seriously in love with this girl where she was, for the lack of a better term, eh, about it. there would be lapse in communication for weeks at a time despite my effort to reach out to her. she just wasn't allocating any capacity emotionally to take it all seriously. devastated, but life goes on.

throughout our relationship there is always guys who are super into her, i mean, reasonably so, she's a beautiful, amazing human being, inside and out. and there's always one guy that i know is totally in love with her and you all know the feeling, something is afoot. not that i didn't trust her, but his motives are 95% of the time questionable. 

fast forward to today, i passed my fundamentals of engineering exam and was super excited to tell my friends on facebook. a picture of them together in a black 'n' white, adorable, super wide smile fashion sits on the center of my screen. my face freezes, my hand shook, and my fragile heart breaks into a thousand pieces all over again.

 

p.s. this is my first post on reddit, and here's a gif of me diving into a pool of feels.

481,Tamir,"now this happened when i was at the mere age of 14. 

i was going through this stage where i wanted to prank everyone and everything. i have no earthly idea why. 

now, to start off with this story, let me tell you about my father and i's relationship. my father and i never really bunted heads with each other, and we would always make each other laugh. it's been ages since i made him disgruntled in the slightest. so naturally i had my guard down on this certain weekend. 

it was a weekend night, and my extended family came over for a party (i don't remember why). everyone was having a good time and my dad came home from work, greeted everyone, and then immediately changed into his weekend clothes which consisted of pajama pants and a t-shirt. i myself was having fun. but being my idiotic fourteen year old self, i noticed my dad's ""loose"" pajama pants and decided i had to get a load of it. 

""it is perfect,"" i thought to myself. so i snuck up to my father, grabbed his pants by his waists, and slid them off faster than ever. i smiled and laughed, expected everyone else including my father to join in, but after 2 seconds i saw my dad's red face when he went and pulled his pants back up. everyone was quiet. i look over him and noticed my 6 year old sister was right in front of my dad when i ""pantsed"" him. she probably saw the bulge up close.  

my dad didn't say anything, but i could see that he didn't want to talk at all. he went in his room and didn't come out for the rest of the night. 

i was terrified for the punishment. i was never in trouble and the anticipation was murderous. i just pulled my dads pants in front of 7+ family and especially my little sister. 

but alas, my dad came down to my room when everyone was gone, and told me not to do that ever again and just walked away after that. it still haunts me to this day, and i bet my father feels the same.",
483,Tamir,"this actually happened today, so i expect extra fake internet points. ok, here we go. so a bunch of friends and me are in a decently large chat group on facebook of around 20 people where we discuss plans to hang out and such. so today, a friend of mine we'll call james and i were eating tacos at lunch and thought it would be funny to convince people on the chat that i had lost two fingers while working at my job. i work in an outdoor shop where we occasionally cut rope so it was believable. so we sent a message on the chat. at first no one responded until james' girlfriend started panicking and asking if we were serious. james recommended we should stop at this point. i didn't. as abroham lincoln said, go big or go home. so, i then (still on james' phone) continued it going in to detail about how i was bummed i wouldn't be able to play piano anymore. (i'm a big piano player and i enjoy it a ton). so i go on with life after this, go to the supermarket and get popsicles for everyone at the branch, quickly forgetting about the big mistake we unknowingly made. we get back to the branch, and james' girlfriend who we'll call juno gets ultra mad, and breaks up with him. so at this point i'm feeling pretty shitty for ending their relationship singlehandedly. right after this, my mom comes rushing into the work panicking and asking if i'm okay. it turns out one of the people in the group chat, who we'll call brennen told his mom, (a hand therapist) who immediately turned around from their vacation and started heading home while sending panicky ""sorry about duncan"" (my theoretical name) texts to my mom. lastly three of my friends left their jobs to head to the hospital where i wasn't actually there.",5. Completely guilty
494,Tamir,"not today, but years ago, during my freshman year of high school. i'd always been the quiet type, who crushed on girls way out of my league but never acted on it because it would be a waste of my time. so then, during class while my table was working on a project, the girl across from me asks ""hey, [my name], would you go out with me?"" just totally out of the blue. the me at the time hadn't had any relationships at that point and wasn't comfortable getting in one, especially when caught off guard like that, so i said 'thanks, but no,' claiming i was too busy with schoolwork, although not nearly as eloquently as you're probably imagining. she and her friends never really had much to say to me after that, and i can't say i blame them. word of that incident spread around the school like wildfire and absolutely killed my dating life even more than it already was, and it got to the point that i had to reiterate to a girl i was asking out senior year 3 times that i was serious.",1. Not guilty
495,Tamir,"recently, i have been reading self help books to get better with people. i struggle connecting with other people emotionally. friends too. and one thing that really stuck out to me was to show honest and sincere appreciation. like for the things around me or the people around me or the people that have been involved in my life.
my uncle is a seriously great guy and was a huge role model for me growing up. i really felt like i hadn't ever told him that growing up and decided to write him a letter saying what he means to me and thanking him for being a big part of my life.  

another concept that stuck out to me was exposing your vulnerabilities to other people and i thought that was great. it's exhilarating. when you open up to a stranger and tell them a little something about your life. then i had the greatest idea. i could share my letter to my uncle with a few girls i was currently talking to. this is where it goes downhill. i told myself next time i see them in person, i'll challenge myself to open up more and share the contents of a really personal letter. i now realize this was a flawed idea looking at it from any angle. the first being that it's creepy. i've met these girls a handful of times and i asked them to read something like deep. its not even like i shared it with them in a genuine way. literally like heres how i view myself and my relationship with my uncle and read it. but it gets worse. for whatever reason, i describe the concept of my letter as a little book with my thoughts and i opened up in there and i wanted them to read it. so they literally just asked if it was diary and it seemed like one so i just agreed. i now realize i asked these girls i barely know to just read my diary.",3. Moderately guilty
499,Tamir,"this is my tifu. i did this yesterday actually and kind of almost been paralyzed with not knowing what to do. i feel like i messed up my life with this mistake. i have been planning a trip to go live with my girlfriend. we have had a long distance relationship for 4 years now. we have been planning me moving there for a full year and a half now. i have been meticulously saving back money for awhile for everything i need to get there and get set up there. 

i had 1500 saved up finally and we both planned for me to be there 2 months from now. i was getting things in order and yesterday i came home to find my window was broke and someone had broken in. i had the money hidden well and my mess up was not having it in a bank account somewhere. unfortunately i know who did it but can't prove it. so now i am sitting here absolutely broken.

i don't know what to tell my girlfriend. i feel lost now. my plan is shattered and because i was incredibly stupid. i am going to talk to her on friday. i'm just not sure what i am going to say. she was depending on me to be there with her and start a life together. a life we have been waiting so long on. i have a feeling this will tear us apart. i don't want it to.

this was my biggest mess up ever. the best advice i can give to anyone is do not store alot of money at your house for any reason. just don't. put it in a banking account because if not, you may find one day the same thing i have and it may ruin your life. they have an investigator coming out but my gut feeling is that he won't be able to do anything about it.

all i have done since i found out is call the police and make a report. other than that, i have sat on my bed and mostly crying as i message her and pretending to be okay. she is wondering why i won't skype with her. just telling her i don't feel good. please someone learn from this story and don't do what i did. i feel incredibly stupid and i essentially ruined my life.",3. Moderately guilty
509,Tamir,"it's 4:20 am as i write this haha.

so this all culminated in the last 30 minutes. to set the mood, my best friend and i were smoking a couple of doobies and talking about the upcoming semester. for those interested it was platinum kush, because we only smoke the finest here in california. anyway i have to be up for work in a few hours so, i decided to call it a night. he takes off and i go to bed. i listen to music while i unwind, so i play ween's masterpiece ""god ween satan"". i'm tripping pretty cool to the music so i decided to find a link on *youtub so my friend could check it out when he  got home. my stoned brain hit the text message conversation below the one i had going  with him. the conversation i selected was the one i was having with my recently ex-girl i sex. 

the fuck up is, that album has such titles as, ""you fucked up"", and ""common bitch"". obviously these songs are telling some girl she is a cunt. as appropriate as they might be for the current times i was trying to build the relationship back. not only because i want to hit that one more time, but because we have tickets to see mccartney in august, and she has them.

 

* youtub is not a typo, just trying to avoid copyright infringement.  those bastards at  goggle  will sue the shit out of me.",4. Very guilty
510,Tamir,"happened a couple weeks ago but i'll submit anyway.

i should prelude that my wife is finnish and sometime ago for me a bracelet with a copper charm stamped with the word ""rakas""
so i was sitting front row of my finnish class when the teacher asked for a definition of the word rakas. after others took some guesses i spouted out that it translates to ""my love"" or similar to ""dearest"".

my teacher looks at me approvingly, and without hesitation or explanation i point enthusiastically at my wrist. my teacher was clearly confused by the gesture and quickly shuffled papers and moved on. now i'm afraid that my teacher only knows about my relationship with my hand, and nothing about my relationship with my wife.",2. Slightly guilty
516,Tamir,"so here's the deal. about a month ago i met this gorgeous girl at a party. we didn't hit it off so well because apparently i was being a little jerk to her and on top of that i was drunk. i got her name, but not her number. so fast forward a few weeks and we began hanging out. there was this one time where i asked if she would like to come with me to an event in the city and she said yes! but on the day, she said she didn't feel comfortable hanging out with me because she has a boyfriend.



that's where i should have stopped but i didn't. instead i kept messaging her and asking if she was down to hang out. she agreed to watch a movie with me. i didn't find it romantic at all but we did talk a bit after getting out of the theater and plus we ate together. we shook hands and parted ways.



then she told me she needs her laptop fixed and so i went to her place, fixed it and she told me she'd repay me. we went out for coffee and then we went back to my place. i showed her around and she enjoyed hearing me play the guitar. 


she texted me the following days about how the guitar was something she didn't expect to see from me. we messaged a little more after that.


so here we are. the weekend of november 15-16. she came over saturday night with alcohol. i knew what was going to happen but i felt like a jerk for not stopping myself. she got tipsy and i got tipsy as well. i played her a song and she kissed me outta the blue. then she got up, talked about her relationship...


and she left for a bit, came back and kissed me. then it led to the bed. it wasn't the best sex ever but we did it twice. once when we were tipsy and another time the next morning (a few hours ago).

1.my mom and i don't have the best relationship, and i want to change that

2.my moms always wanted to get a thai massage, so i said ""what the hell, my treat""

3.i'm a bit of a horn dog (relevant username)

4.i, like most people, don't think straight when i first wake up

5.i laugh when i'm nervous

today, i took my mom to get that thai massage. the thing is, i'm a very stressed man and when she asked me to join her, i thought ""what the hell"" and decided to get a massage of my own, too. i could use a little r&r. my masseuse was this cute asian lady, who was a gift from the gods at masseusing. fast forward 20 minutes, i'm out cold

anyone know that russel peters act where he talks about that thai massage he had? if not, here's the jist: in thailand, after a massage they ""[finish you off](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/5/50/if-you-know-what-i-mean.png/revision/latest?cb=20120430002743)."" for whatever reason even before realizing i would be getting a thai massage today, i was thinking about that act. 

i wake up with the asian rubbing down my inner thighs, and i realize, with every rub she's getting closer to *there*. obviously she doesn't plan on touching it, but my boner is now about 6 inches farther to my right than she thinks, as my thing was lined in my boxers. just waking up and all, and being a fucking idiot, i do nothing. i truly think i'm white russel peters right now. well, when in ~~rome~~ thailand...

**eeekk** she got a big handful of something she didn't expect to grab, freaked out and started yelling in **insert language here*. i, now fully awake, start laughing hysterically, 3 feet from my mother, who is now awake and sees this unfold. the manager comes over because i'm a fucking pervert in his eyes and kicks us out on the spot. it's been like 3 hours and i still haven't talked to my mom. reddit, tifu",2.

yesterday i ran into an issue at work, so being the type of guy i am and the fact that i had just passed 40hrs 3 days into this work week, i decided to hit the team with a spicy ol timey meme. but in my heart of hearts, i knew it didn't really fit with the season. so like any decent troll, i set out to better myself through knowledge. i approached the team's exhausted graphic designer and ask him to teach me a simple skill: putting santa hats on memes.

a little background, him and i have a friendly adversarial relationship... he gives me shit because i don't like platformers (aka cup head and mario) i troll him that he's a giant lotr fan who didn't even know who tom bombadil was. anyway, he agrees to teach me the ways of the pen tool and layered images... because what else should productive employees be doing at 10 pm 14 hours into the workday, while the project burns around them besides spending 30 mins making memes. 

i start to get a bad feeling when he quickly finds an old photo of me off google and starts to cut it out... a few mins later the cubicle row is cheering him on as he demonstrates different techniques by grafting my face into a stock photo. i laugh, but really i'm dying inside while i watch him visually craft me into a torrid love affair with a much older woman.

the next morning i come into work to find that he'd passed the image off to the other graphic artists on the team and they'd designed our companies new christmas cards featuring me and my photoshopped love affair with an older woman. the worst part of it all? he was moving too fast by the end so the only thing i can do to battle the shame is put a hat on a meme :(",2.

537,Tamir,"this didn't happen exactly today, but the realization has been slowly coming to me over time.  it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like.  i started noticing little stuff; i'd feel a little  jealous when guys would hit on her, think about how good she always looks, realize how much i loved to hear her laugh and just be with her in general.

the problem is, we've been good friends for a while, we have a lot of mutual friendships built up together..and she has a boyfriend.  dude is a good guy as far as i know, treats her well, she really likes him.  i find myself wishing they'd break up (which is extremely selfish and petty in this situation), which likely won't happen.  i get jealous when she talks about him, which i have no right to do.

all in all, seeing her less is not an option in my life at this point.  i'll be seeing her everyday for at least the next year.  i've felt this way for a long time, but i wasn't sure if it was my own insecurity about lack of relationships or that it was her.  it's definitely her, everything about her.  i fell for her because i honestly like everything about her; every quirk and idiosyncrasy is cute, love talking to her...  and i'm the bad guy in this situation, and i don't know how to change what's in my heart.",3.

michael stopped looking at pokeporn sites because he thought it was kinda weird but i kept perusing the sites and would occasionally send him a link to an especially obscure or childhood ruining image.

i've been seeing this guy for about 3 weeks now. he's fantastic and we were really getting along amazingly. 

last night, we were in bed and he was going down on me. we were both very drunk, and my mind was a little fuzzy and distracted. at that moment i apparently decided to softly call out ""oh, james."". i barely even remember doing it as things were getting pretty good downstairs. the man i am seeing is not called james. not even a little bit. 

he immediately stopped what we were doing and got angry and upset. rightfully so. i was too drunk to go home so we spent an awkward night laying next to each other in silence. his angry, mine apologetic. 

before this happened we were approaching a point where we were going to take things a step further and be in a relationship. now, i don't know if i will ever see or hear from him again.

the worst part of all this? the man's name i called out in the heat of the moment was a coworker who i am not even interested in. 

 


edit:

thank you all for your advice and encouragement. he came over and we talked about it. his feelings are still a little hurt but he was very understanding for the most part and has agreed to let the whole thing go. i still feel like an asshole, but as a lot of you have said, accidents happen. thanks again to everyone out there who took time to read my post. you're all great!",4.

564,Tamir,"i'm a freshman in an american college about three hours from my hometown. i had some trouble making friends and getting to know people, as most people do their first year at college. this, coupled with the fact that i just got out of a highly abusive relationship, was why i allowed my friend (we'll call her ann) to set me up with her very attractive friend (we'll call him andy). 

as most girls do with their girl friends, we stalked him. i noticed his hometown was very close to mine and that he even went to a school that i was supposed to go to (pay attention to this). 

yesterday, ann and her boyfriend met with me and andy for dinner. this was my first time meeting andy, but i already knew quite a bit about him. the conversation goes normally, ""where are you from?"" ""what major are you?"" etc. after finding out that we live pretty close to each other, he asks me where i went to school. after i tell him, i decide to tell him that in my senior year, my school beat his at our homecoming. he looks confused, so i insist that it happened. eventually i go quiet after realizing he never told me where he went to school.

so, my girlfriend arrives and everything goes well, they really like each other and they get along (and they still do), everything's going awesome and relieve myself since nothing went grong that day.

fast forward to later that night, it's getting late so i went to drop g at her parents and we talk about how well everything went and how that is really good since we want our parents to be ok with our relationship since it's really serious and important to our lives.

so i head home and my mom receives me anxious to talk about how she feels about g. she actually loved her and is really happy that we found each other. 

then it happens.

she starts talking about how cute she is and i feel great, but the last words are still echoing sometimes inside my head when i think i already forgot them.

she says that she looks a lot like her younger sister, i guess she didn't realize the weight of her words but i, being the analytical wierdo that i am, realize something.

570,Tamir,"first off... i am 16 and have been depressed since i-can't-remember-when, this has made me quite cynical, pessimistic and all around miserable. i've never gotten professional help other than a single visit to a psychologist who hinted i was depressed, though this was a long time ago and it has gotten worse to the point where even an idiot would come to the conclusion that i was depressed.

so far, the only person i've told this is a used-to-be-close friend of mine, and that was because she nagged me until i told her what was wrong.
at first she didn't know how to react and tried to awkwardly cheer me up by saying such things as ""you shouldn't feel this way"" and ""you have a good life"", etc. many times i tried to explain that this wasn't me not wanting to find joy in life, and that it was me being physically unable to do so, but she kept insisting that i being too negative. either way, having someone to support me made me feel like i could crawl my way out of this hole i had been living in.

time went by and on valentine's day, she confessed having feelings for me... she knew about how i felt for her, so we ended up in a strange situation where she was my best friend who acted like my girlfriend in secret and was also a sort of my therapist, this didn't last much... eventually she confessed she didn't really have such strong feelings for me and that she'd been acting like that in order to cheer me up. this revelation crushed me due to some past events that i won't be discussing right now. but on the bright side, she also said that she actually grew fond of me to the point were no acting was needed anymore, so we continued our ""relationship"" until yesterday.

after putting up with me during many of my ups and downs, she grew tired of it and decided to give up. she gave me a lengthy rant about how tired she was of my negative attitude and cynicism, how tired she was of trying to help me change only for me to have another episode. her final words were basically ""talk to me when you're feeling better, and if you never do, then never talk to me again"".

572,Tamir,"so me and my friend john, we were on skype having fun studying for a test. suddenly, john tells me of this super easy way to edit facebook chats. while we're messing around with chats between us saying like ""suck my dick"" and etc., we suddenly get the idea to play a prank with this new trick on our 3 best friends, 2 of which recently became single (really dickish, i know). 

but anyways, so there's joseph, sarah, and claire. joseph and sarah were the ones who recently got out of a relationship. anyways, so i edit chats between sarah and me, and claire and me. now both of these chats were edited to saying things like ""i like joseph but don't tell him"". and then i screenshotted my work.

so then i went to joseph and started telling him about this, and of course he didn't believe me and wanted proof, so i sent him the pictures. and then shit went down.

he then starts telling me about he had sorta started having feelings for sarah after both of them broke up, and now i'm feeling really bad because i don't want him to do something stupid with her because all 5 of us are really close friends. (john was dating sarah before they split so now you can kinda see the vultures circling..)

anyways, so i flat out tell him it was a prank by me and joseph so he doesn't do anything stupid and boom it was a trap to get me to admit it. and then he tells sarah and claire.

now, sarah and claire and get mad us. i don't really get too much of a yelling because everyone knows i pull stupid shit like this.(sidenote: john and joseph got in a sorta slap fight in which joseph gets hurt and cries. tensions rose from that because people made fun of him for crying, but joseph and john try to put it behind them)

now, john is getting all this shit thrown in his face for ""giving no shits about his and sarah's old relationship"" and for ""fucking with people too much and not taking the repercussions"".

now, i'm a pretty friendly guy and usually playfully flirt with everyone (the gf knows this and i never overstep). i worked out jill lived really close to me and offered to drive her to and fro work whenever we had the same shift (the gf also knew this and was cool with it, i'm quite a friendly guy in general...at least i tell myself that). anyway, we got on pretty well and started talking a lot more outside of work. you guys can see where this is going...

okay, so this actually happened four years ago, during a cold winter. this is all in texas, so the temperature can fluctuate like a mofo. i had a friend, a close friend, who was the only person i could ever really talk to very well. all the things that i wouldn't talk to other people about, i could talk to her about, and she was one of the only people who i never felt like i had to wear a mask around. basically, i was crushing hard. like, dreaming about her and shit. i never did anything about it, however. why? simple, because i was and still am a frightened little pussy. so we remained just friends for quite a long time.

after a while, she actually attempted to move our relationship up a level. she asked me out on a date. as she did so, we both visibly reddened. i was ecstatic, though i didn't show it through my overwhelming embarrassment. she had finally taken the step that i was too chicken-shit to take myself. we decided to just go to a small local coffee shop, and set the date for two weeks later, as she was going out of town for a family reunion soon. well, over the time that she was gone, i came down with the flu. i had never had the flu before, and of course my first time to ever get it was then. i was beating myself for putting off getting a flu shot for as long as i did, but at this point it didn't matter. i was aching, coughing and struggling to do much of anything. of course, i had to call her and cancel, no matter how much i didn't want to. i had hoped that maybe once i had recuperated we could reschedule the date. quite retardedly, however, i never thought to contact her and suggest that.

fairly soon after, possibly even before i was well, she met someone else online, and started going out with him. i say going out, but since they lived quite far apart, it was just chatting online. it ruined my chance at a relationship, however. now, it's four years later, we're both twenty, she's moved away and is still seeing him, and i've been alone ever since.

my girl tells me to take my time and really pushes me to do what i want, as long as i share the news with her.

""actually i'd love to go, so i can say goodbye to london""

discussion continues casually, then i see her yesterday we have a very nice time. i am very scared to tell her, because we have a great time and i don't want to ruin the mood :/

  anyway, e and i decide that things are going pretty well, and agree to go on an official date. i pick her up (very far out of my way) and bring her back to a bar i frequent, as she is not a citizen of the country and has 'lost her passport' in a larger near-by city. everything goes great, the owner of the bar agrees to give her a job, and my life seems to be on easy street. we get back to her place, she introduces me to her father who seems to like me and gives me consent to spend the night with his daughter (i thought this was wierd, but it's also important.)

  so we spend from about 3am - 6am fooling around and getting absolutely nasty. eventually its time to sleep, and she drops the bomb. although she had told me she was 25, and certainly looked and acted the part, she was in fact only 16... which is why she introduced me to her father for consent.. i'm 30. i didnt panic, and still spent the night in her bed, but come the next day i am left speechless, unsure of how to continue this 'relationship.'",5.

my girlfriend had just gone downstairs and i was finishing a conversation with her parents upstairs. after finishing the conversation, i headed downstairs, i notice she's in the bathroom. being the quick-thinking guy i am, i silently run across the room and hide in the corner to wait for her to come out of the bathroom. this way, when the door opened it would be blocking her view from me. for the record, the room is pitch black - i was gonna scare her so well! 

fast forward 15 seconds of waiting, the door opens and i prepare to strike! once she walks out i leave my spot from against the wall and go to grab her waist from behind. the next thing i realize is feeling a quick strike of pain to my face, seeing stars, and laying on the floor. 

by this point, she is screaming, i'm cursing, her parents are probably thinking we're having sex in their house. i'm no small guy either at 6'2, 190 lbs (not saying i'm big, but i've started varsity at offensive line for a few years now), and just finished my senior year of football, but she took me down in one hit. 

apparently i was a murderer for a fraction of a second in the pitch black and paid the ultimate price. i'm proud of her for being able to throw out a good punch if she had to :)

604,Tamir,"so first off this wasn't me but i felt like this story was way to funny to waste.

so once upon a time, about 2 years ago me, friend #1 and friend #2 decided to go tubing (for those in tropical and or have never gone tubing, tubing is basicly getting in a huge tire tube and going speeding down a snow covered hill most of the time at somesort of a skiing resort) 

anyways we were having fun time and just connect our tubes together by join hands, almost like in a triangle, but one run we decided to let go just as we started down the hill.

me and friend #2 make it down before friend #1 by a fair bit, his tube had a lot more friction causing him to slow basicly to a halt, so friend #2 gets of his tube at the end of the run a throws it into the pile of tubes to be brought back up. then he noticed that friend #1 wasn't down the hill all the way and decided to pull a mini prank on friend #2, so he planned to put his leg out and stop the tube causing friend #1 to fly off it and land in the snow. 

well it didn't work out like this, friend #2 raised his foot and misses the tube all together and ends up kicking friend #1 in the face in the freezing cold, for whom ever doesn't know hurts a metric shit ton, so friend #1 who is seeing stars and laying on the ground lays there for a few seconds. when all of a sudden a group of around 5 girls come flying down the run at moch 5 and run over him, around like three of the 5 tubes went over him.

in the end he was ok though, besides the bruse on his face and being freezing cold and friend #2 feeling like an asshole.",
605,Tamir,"this happened to me about an hour ago. the wounds are still very fresh.

my story starts by saying that i'm a teacher who just took the summer off and now as the school year has started to pick up i'm looking for a new place of employment. so, i've been going through the steps of visiting school sites, applying, getting my clearences up to date and all the like.

i get a call back from one of my applications and am scheduled for an interview on thursday of this week. i'm excited and call my parents to tell them about it.

 so, this is where the fu begins. i tell them that i have an interview on thursday and they respond by telling me ""that isnt very much warning"" because today is wednesday. i had figured that in my time off and long days of summer i had lost a day and in hindsight really should have double checked.

so i arrive at the new school to a very confused looking supervisor. i introduce myself, and very quickly am asked why i am here today. 


myself: ""well, i was scheduled for an interview on thrusday am i right?""


**already taking out my phone to double check the email**

interviewer: ""today is wednesday...""

my heart fucking sunk into my stomach. i began stumbling over my words a little bit. she handed me the paperwork and had me wait while she finished up another meeting.

so one day my wife has the day off work we decide to go to this australian place in the netherlands. i see they have a burger that says it's spicy. now i love spicy foods of all kinds and decide to order it. the waitress apparently is suppose to warn me that it's very spicy, which she does. i think nothing of it.

burger is in front of me and i am oh so happy because it looks and smells amazing. i take a huge bit of this burger. chew. chew. chew. swallow. well that's not so bad. for about 3 seconds until the fires of hell are overflowing from my face hole. i am so red, and my wife and the couple next to us are laughing at this. my wife then decides to tell me that the burger has a dry rub and a sauce that is made with ghost peppers. needless to say, everyone got a good laugh out of this. even i did. until it was time to do the business later that night. i damn near thought my asshole was going to start bleeding.

greg:what the fuck are you doing with my phone?
my friend:(my name) gave me the password!
me: i had nothing to do with this!
greg:fuck you! how did you know my pw?

until i hit a patch of black ice, and couldn't. my car started to slide, directly towards the stopped pickup in front of me. brakes were useless. e-brake was useless. i put the car into a slow spin to eat up some forward momentum, and after what seemed like a terrifying eternity, stopped with a sickening crunch, 90 degrees to the traffic flow with cars skidding by all around me. 

thankfully, i was ok and my car was drivable - i'd hit the truck's tow hitch with my rear bumper. but the driver motioned for me to pull into the police station parking lot across the street. fuck, i've never had a ticket, not even a parking ticket. god, god damnit.

in the lot, i got out of my car as the other driver approached me. my junkyard-personal-protection-mutt-militia goes *apeshit*, as the driver says something over the ruckus about 'getting one of his lieutenants out to take a look...paperwork....insurance ""...
i hadn't hit *a* cop, i'd hit *the* city's police commander. fml.

turns out he's a pretty nice guy, and he even joked that he *almost* made it to retirement without an accident. sorry, man :/ because the damage was less than $1000 (zero damage to his truck, thankfully, and just some paint missing from my bumper), nothing was filed and i was on my way. though his lieutenant did say my dog was a hell of a body guard...",2.

650,Tamir,"obligatory ""this technically did not happen today but i am experiencing the result of the fuck up today blah blah blah.""

for my networking class, i had a 100 point assignment that took up 10% of my final grade.  it was not bad at all. all i had to do was to read instructions from the textbook and prove i read those instructions. it was the second one of these types of assignments where i got a 100% on the first.  i was all but guaranteed to get the same grade on this one.  

the assignment was due friday, october 14th. i finished it well before the deadline (which is a first for me) on wednesday the 12th. my college was off for fall break and i wanted to get it done early because i do not have one of the required programs for the assignment at my home.

well, when i finished it on wednesday afternoon, uploaded it to the website we were suppose to submit it through and clicked ""ok."" i enjoyed my long weekend until this very afternoon (two days after the deadline).  i logged onto the website i submitted it to only to realize it did not take my submission.  

i assume it was because of a glitch. well, i decided to upload another file and i noticed after i uploaded it and clicked ""ok"" i had to click another button that said ""submit."" 

fuck. me.

because i did not click one button, i lost 10% of my grade.  one mouse click was the difference in a letter grade.  this is also the second time i uploaded the file; i should have known what i was doing.  i am so salty right not.",2. Slightly guilty

typical day at the office: getting paid $28/hr to browse reddit and drink coffee for 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. i came across a thread on 4chan about a guy who ordered a bunch of gay porn and used a third party to have it anonymously sent to one of his friends' weddings as their gift. thought this idea was hilarious.

anyway, my pc was getting repaired for the day so my boss told me he had a new one hooked up at my desk for me to use. it looked like the exact same lenovo t420 that i had been using, and i forgot that my own was in service. anyway, i logged into the network and hit up amazon to purchase some videos of dudes sucking cock.

i add a couple to my cart and order. done! just had to wait until they arrived so i could forward them through the third party to my best friends wedding.

anyway, my boss comes into the engineering department 2 days later furious as to who ordered a bunch of gay porn on his amazon account. he found out that someone in the engineering room had accessed his account somehow.

anyway, he said he is gonna cut the bonuses of our whole department if nobody confesses by tuesday, and that he is gonna fire whoever did it.",4. Very guilty

burger chains sell a lot of soda, especially now during summer when the temperature's getting up there. so, naturally, they need a lot of soda to sell. but, because it's more efficient, they get a more syrup-y liquid that they mix with carbonated water when it's sold. because coca cola is the most popular soda to be ordered, they get more of it than other syrups. they get boxes with bags inside, measuring 250 liters (about 66 gallons). 

instead of taking this box down to the ground floor like they're supposed to, the delivery man left this large box at the top of a couple steps of stairs. there's a diagonal lift installed, all you have to do is get the hand pallet truck and load it onto the lift, and hold the ""descend"" button.

**fuckup starts**  
there was a bump, the spot where a metal flap hinges on the actual lift, it's there so you can actually drive the hand trucks onto the thing, and i couldn't get over it. so i put some muscle into it, got myself a tiny bit of extra momentum to get over the bump and onto the lift with these 250 liters of syrupy blackness.

the reason this post is here. i went too far, it tumbled over the edge, hand truck and all, i screamed ""no no no no!"", like any fucker-upper would, and after standing around panicking for a good 3 minutes, co-workers coming to check what the screaming and crashing was about, i had to spend the rest of my shift cleaning up with a rubber scraper, shoving all of this sticky goo into the sewers. silver lining, four of the bigger bosses didn't arrive until after most of it was cleaned up. took around 2 and a half hours.

667,Tamir,"2 months ago i was having dinner in a restaurant with my father. i was stressed and not having such a good day which started to work out on my stomach. when that happens my throat starts to burn up and i get these puke reflexes. normally only the food comes out but this time started puking blood. at the restaurant. obviously that freaked the living hell out of me, got taken to a hospital and was examined after the puking stopped. i had to stay the night (which was pretty horrible thanks to my snoring 'roommate') and in the morning got a gastroscopy.

the tests indicated i had inflammations in my stomach and esophagus, which along with the stress and puking caused a little artery to rupture. it looked more severe than it actually was, and i just needed to take some meds for a few months.

my mom's medical insurance (via her work) covers the entire family, so we sent an application to them along with some paperwork from the hospital. they asked for details of the gastroscopy and the notes of the specialist. so we mailed him, and he his discontent for having to send this but in the end he did, reluctantly. 

weeks go by and we get a mail back from the insurance company that they more details and requested all the details from the blood tests that were taken. knowing what a prick he's been about sending his notes, my mom and i kind of feared for what would happen. he sent us the blood results but demanded that all requests happened through **him** and not us, and requested to see all the paperwork and demands the insurance company sent to us. so we did, but that wasn't enough for him:

we got a call from his secretary, who told us he wanted that the insurance company sent him a letter, directly addressed to him (since all the previous ones were addressed to my mother). we called the insurance company, who responded with a ""we'll look into it"" and afterwards a ""we won't do that"". seems as if mr. specialist stepped on some toes.

so here we are. am i wrong to think that guy is a major pain in the ass?",1. Not guilty
668,Tamir,"dear reddit, today i fucked up by trying to take a break

see this is how it is, i’m a 20 year old college student who lives at home, the last 3 days at college has been absolute hell because of finals in preparation for the summer exams so i’ve been really stressed and busy, on top of that my father has been in and out of hospital with various illnesses, basically it’s been tough of late. 

last night after sorting out my final work, coming home late, cooking for the family and sorting everything out i went to play some videogames with an online friend, i believed i deserved a break from all this stress, afterwards i stayed up late browsing reddit and talking to friends so by the time i settled down to sleep it was almost 3am.  i vaguely remembered my mother mentioning she wanted me to go grocery shopping the next morning but i didn’t really think about it.  

this morning i got woken by an angry mother yelling at me that she would have to go buy groceries because i was still asleep, this was like 11am, apparently she had tried to wake me but i’m a very heavy sleeper in the mornings and had no recollection of that.  next thing i hear an almighty bang so loud i thought the door had been ripped off.  mother was home carrying heavy shopping bags and swearing all sorts as me as i run down to the kitchen clearly just out of bed.  she was furious that i had not woken up and helped her inside with the bags, she was soooooo disappointed.  i felt like shit about this naturally and any motivation to do anything on my day off melted away.  later when bringing my father his medicine and food he too reprimanded me for being an awful daughter and reminding me of my mother’s heart condition and saying i should take better care of her and not let her down like that (which i rarely ever do, i just wanted a break) so now i feel even more like a waste of space and i just want to crawl into a hole and hide for the rest of my life.",4.

680,Tamir,"this actually happened today! surprise! warning for this being kind of lame and actually not that much of a fuck-up.

so, my school has multiple buildings that unlock with an id card. the doors are unlocked between classes so people wouldn't have to constantly unlock the doors.

today, for whatever reason, the doors were locked. i was heading to first period -- which is in a different building from where we have to stand before school starts -- and couldn't get into my building. my id wasn't working, which was odd, but it was okay since someone was leaving the building.

there's stairs almost immediately upon entering the building, and as i'm going up them i hear the door close. naturally, i figure that people would use their id to get in. i get to the landing, look back because i hear tugging on the door. they're locked out -- so i don't think ids were working at all.
i point and laugh at them because while we're not necessarily friends, i can joke with them like that.

have you ever turned a corner at the same time someone else did, and you both temporarily stop right before a collision?

it was kind of like that. i turned around, and walked right into an open door. talk about instant karma.
i hope no one saw, but i knew they did... because they mentioned it a minute or so later when they managed to get in... and then they brought it up in government, four hours later.

so, naturally, that would be the end of it, right?

well, i got a call from my school a few hours ago that there was a security breach right around the time school let out, that the police were investigating, and we didn't have school tomorrow -- that's gotta be the worst/best reason to not have school.

i learned from my local news website that they're, naturally, going to be checking security footage.

that means someone's most likely going to be looking at the footage -- especially since this was first thing in the morning, near the entrance of a building -- and see my dumb ass running into a fucking door. i hope it amuses them.",2. Slightly guilty
691,Tamir,"i work in a kitchen as a kitchen hand, wo odsy i get into work and i see balloons on tables and streamers that say happy 80th birthday, not really my concern so i get to work.

the whole birthday procession arrives and other patrons of the eatery, wednesdays are usually fairly quiet at my work so this birthday procession of 40 people really throws a spanner into the works.

in the rush to get their meals along with other patrons meals out, i'm dashing in and out of the cold room, grabbing knick knacks and paddy wacks, on one of these said trips i pull a box of bread rolls from a top shelf, as the box is angling down, a smaller white box slides off the bread box, glances off the top of my head and plonks onto the ground.

i grab the small white box, chuck it back onto the topshelf and exit the cold room with the box of bread.

about an hour later, the birthday party comes to get their cake, another person grabs the box for the party.

i hear over the roar of the burners, sizzle of the steaks, and cursing of the chefs, 

what the f**k is this!!!

i look over and see the small white box. i felt my heart poking out of my butt hole like a hemorrhoid, i had dropped the cake for a party of 40 people. the best part is i hadn't even realised my fuck up when the fuck up had occurred.

my school in  6th grade it used to go on field trips a lot. like 7th grade there was a detroit science museum visit, and 8th grade cedar point, but for 6th grade it is the best, go from michigan genesee county, to chicago. it was a long trip and our bus was ok it had about 3 tvs per strip of seating spaced out, so it was bearable, until the night when we were coming back to school. around this time i remember a brand of chips called jengos and in the commercial all the people were yelling the name. it was decently funny. 

on the bus ride back it was night time and everyone was asleep and a chaperone thats actually a staff member that took place of a different person , was just perusing around making sure nothing stupid like affection or anything was happening, and i was sitting next to my best friend , we will call him e . e was a really silly guy who did really well on his school work, and we were pals since about 3rd-4th grade. well, he was up and tried getting my attention and tapped my shoulder. i instantly, no thought no nothing screamed jengos. i about pissed myself when the chaperone got superbly irate.

 she starts asking who did that and why they were stupid yada ydada yada, and my pal e helps me out . he says ""well it couldn't have been deathiaz, because he is asleep and i can't seen to wake him up hes so knocked out."" and i about orgasmed with relief. i still thank him to this day for doing what he did. he probably saved me from suspension. and it was night time so , no one could've seen me move or analyzed the voice cause everyone was pretty sleepy.",2.

eventually i lean over and kiss her. and you, know i like her, i felt like just making out cause i don't have a lot of confidence in my own sexual skills. but she starts unbuttoning her shirt and i panic: i haven't shaved in 5 months and haven't jerked off in a week so i know i would climax way too quickly.  i pull away and she looks at me with a confused look and i just lay there, looking at the ceiling. she turns her back towards me, waits for 30 seconds and says: ""fuck this, i'm going home.""

i convince her to stay for a while and she just keeps asking me what's wrong, what's happening, which is completely understandable cause she is gorgeous and probably has never ever had anyone turn her down. i invite her for a cigarette and we are just sitting there in silence.

she asks me: ""do you have anyone else in your life? have i completely misunderstood what has happened in the past months?""
and i, out of fucking nowhere, just say(why, oh why):""you see, it's really hard for me to get hard."" - the biggest piece of bullshit since the german-soviet nonaggression pact. she doesn't really say much after that. she stays and we go to sleep and i'm just left with a mind poisoned with regret and self-hate.",2.

before i get a ton of questions:
my mother in law freaked out and went to the emergency room thinking this stuff would hurt her eye, but i guess its a water based lube and all it did was irritate her eyes a little bit. apparently it also made her dry eyes go away so in a sense she got the relief she was after o.o",4. Very guilty

after my mate pays, we sit down and start eating, and as we were about halfway through, a guy starts to exit, but before he does so, he put a hand on my shoulder and said ""thanks for the meal"", and left. i was confused, i had thought he mistook me for a worker on lunch break or something. after we had done eating, i pulled the reciet out from my pocket and noticed i had payed $22. i was shocked, how did my sub cost that much?! this is where it all linked up, my sub should of costed $12 (i got bacon which was a extra $2, and a normal sub without bacon would of been $10 (as was my mates).

i started thinking, wait, how did this even happen? did he seriously tell the register person something like ""he's paying for my meal"" as i was looking the other way? i went and asked the register but they said they couldnt really remember what had happend (only been like 20 mins or so but i guess there was quite a bit of people who got subs before and after me).",2.

i was maybe 15 or 16 and on school vacation when my mom landed her first job selling real state after being a home stay mom for most of my life. so to celebrate i wanted to make something for her, you know, being a good son and all. i went through her cookbooks and found a recipe for flan that went just like the one in the gif (seriously try it). it was the first time i cooked anything other than a fried egg and it was going surprisingly well. the caramel melted nicely, the flan was smooth with zero chunks and everything was going according to plan. now, the recipe stated that before putting the flan in the fridge it had to cool down a bit towards room temperature, so i left it there and came later to check the temp.   

at this point i'd already fucked up once. you see, nowhere in my recipe did it say that the caramel and flan should be on the same mold (i figured you make the caramel and puour it on the flan when it's done), but i didn't know it at the time. the real fuckup was when i went to check the temperature, when i chose to just dip my finger in the flan, which was warm, followed by the caramel, which was hotter than a thousand hells. resulted on a 2^nd degree burn of my finger, mom had to take to the er after work and we returned hours later to a busted flan (i didn't put it in the fridge) and the caramel had hardened so we ended up throwing the whole thing out.",2.

skip forward to a few hours ago; i had it on display in public, just to prepare for an event that i had set up. 

so i let people play on it. some time goes by and i notice a strange behaviour on the screen. so i decide to take a close look. upon inspection it seemed fine, nothing special, but i was still wondering why the screen acted so weird. i just thought it was an error with thr hdmi cable or something, so i didn't bother.

i decided to walk away for a few minutes to get some water and when i came back i saw the screen turn off and i felt a smell of burnt plastic coming from the arcade. so i ran to to it, i pulled out the plug and noticed a small light from the inside. 

so i opened it up to find out that one of the cables leading to the screen has caught fire. and at this point i was just trying to protect the other components so i just pulled the plug to the arcade and put out the fire.

but the damage had already been done. a couple of cables are now damaged and i have no screen anymore, so i won't be able to show off my arcade during the event, which sucks tbh.

i'm lucky that i saw it, or else the whole building would be in flames.",1. Not guilty
753,Tamir,"so when i was a kid, i lived on a hill. a lot of the houses had very steep driveways, including the one across the street from me; the driveway sloped down at a very acute angle, ending at a big garage door.

i was about nine, and i had a bowling ball. i don’t know why i had a bowling ball, but i thought it would be kind of awesome if i rolled the ball down the incline leading to my neighbor’s garage door. which i did. i let the ball go, and watched in anticipatory horror as the ball gathered speed, began to bounce, went airborne, and became a fucking cannonball which even the garage door could not resist. the ball hit the door at full force, cracking it into pieces, leaving a gigantic hole and splintered wood. 

of course, i ran away and never told anyone. for weeks, my neighbors fumed about the “vandal” that had destroyed their garage. i kept my mouth shut and years passed. my family moved away, so i never saw the neighbors as an adult.

until a few years ago, when i was pitching a potential new client. this was a huge media organization and the job was worth about five grand - and generally would mean many more jobs and dollars for years to come. i walked into the executive editor’s office, and recognized the name: this was the daughter of the neighbors. she was a few years older than me, and i instantly mentioned - because when you’re pitching, any kind of connection has to be good, right - that i grew up in the same neighborhood, and had in fact lived right across the street.

this went so well that the small talk continued to the point where i laughingly revealed the garage incident. this did *not* go over well. she stared at me, icily, and said: “leave this office before i have you removed.”

i hightailed it and, needless to say, did not get the job i’d hoped. to this day, i’m pretty much blackballed at that outfit.",5. Completely guilty
757,Tamir,"i have a white family and one of those family members is my daughter. my daughter (let's refer to her as mary) loves to play outside and find friends. a few years ago she went outside and found a kid her age (let's call her taylor). now taylor was from a black family, though i figured, ""hey, it's 201x, we should not have any issues."" both mary and taylor loved to play together all the time.

now in recent times, a few issues have arisen. taylor told mary that taylor's grandmother expressed her distaste in having taylor bring someone white over to her house. when mary told me what taylor said, i was enraged that such racism could occur in this day and age, heck my son goes to a school that celebrates how diverse and multi-cultural it is. mary and taylor continued to play together until today something happened.

taylor invited mary over to her house to play when while they were there, taylor's grandmother came out of the house and shouted at taylor, screaming ""why did you bring a white person to our house?"" and then her grandmother promptly kicked taylor,  an 11 year old, out of the house and threatened to call 911. right now my daughter is attempting to console her. i really don't know what's going to happen next.",
762,Tamir,"this happened today. 
back story;

so before moving out of my moms for college, we decided i needed to donate all my old novels and picture books to children less fortunate. my aunt heard about the plan and asked if we could donate the books to a family with 6 children that lived on her street, who's parents she had dinner with form time to time. i donated the novels to a local rec center, and packed the old picture books into a big box and sent them off with my aunt.

now as a kid ,(10-12) i used to take art classes outside of school. i also watched a lot of anime on tvs and from vcrs my neighbour brought. predictably, typical horny art inclined 12 year old decides to draw girls pegging girls in his sketchbook. now, these weren't just any lewd poses of anime girls. these were dick girls  doing hella weird shit. i knew from the moment i drew them that they could never see the light of day. so where does my mom never look? my old kiddie picture books. 



fast forward to today, my aunt arrives for dinner, and i meet her and my mom sitting at the coffee table as i return home from work. here is a pretty word for word convo from ~1hr ago.



""hey redditor, the kids really thank you for the books you sent."" ""they really had a great time picking them out and choosing who gets what""

-oh cool.

""also they found one of your old drawings in the books, its pretty interesting""

-here is the point where i knew.

""theres one on the kitchen table for you, you should check it out""

-fuck",3. Moderately guilty
769,Tamir,"this morning i decided to take a walk to the pawnshop, because i'm looking for a cheap banjo for practice. on my way out of the apartment building, i noticed a **rock** keeping the door propped open. the rules on the door say it should be kept closed and i don't live in the greatest neighborhood (a family friend was mugged near by), so i ~~ignored it~~ moved **it** and closed the door. once outside i notice it's cold, drizzling, and windy, so ~~i head back up for a sweater~~ as i am hurry on my way to the pawnshop. once i got there ~~the clerk was ready for me because i called ahead~~ the place was closed, either i left too early or it was closed due to the weather. now here's the part that matters; i get back to my building and my key won't fit in to the lock. i make sure i'm at the correct building (they all look the same) when **it** dawns on me. someone's key broke off *inside* the lock and that's why the door was propped open with a **rock**. i got buzzed in by some random person because my family was asleep and i replaced the **rock** in hopes no one ~~else gets locked out~~ noticed **it** was moved and that an idiot lives in the building.

775,Tamir,"okay so i live with my grandma while i'm going to classes, she had part of her brain removed so her motor skills aren't the best; as a result she needs 24/7 assistance and on the weekend that is what i do, unless a family member comes to help out.

this particular family member is my grandma's brother, my great uncle. well, shortly after my grandma woke up and he was settled i went back to my room to avoid any awkward silence and played some video games. video games have a habit of making me hungry so i went into the kitchen to fix up some ramen and i overheard part of a conversation my uncle and grandma were having, ""...all i saw was flies, they got there so quickly."" 

to which i responded by saying somewhat excitedly, "" i know! maggots get into everything! i remember i was walking my mom's dog and when she took a crap the flies came out of nowhere and were on it instantly! it is crazy how fast they show up!""

there was a bit of silence and my uncle's head droops a bit before my grandmother promptly says, ""oh, he's talking about his ex wife."" i was confused as he continued on the subject, ""yeah, i walked into the house and all i saw were flies coming out the bathroom, its how i knew she was dead.""

silence again before i awkwardly say, ""oh."" then grandma starts asking him if i ever met her as i sort of just slink back into my shell of a room to again avoid awkward silence.",1. Not guilty
777,Tamir,"backstory: my friend ""kelsey"" works for an electronic vape pen company and sold me my pen. my heating coil broke, so i texted her to buy a new one. she said, ""$30. $20 if you send me nudes. $10 if you also write my name in red lipstick on your chest."" btw, she's a lesbian in a relationship and it was very much a joke. but, i play along. at dinner that night, i borrow a friend's lipstick, go into the bathroom, write ""kelsey"" in big red letters on my chest, snap some nudies, and send them.

the next day is rosh hashanah (jewish new year). i go to my boss' family brunch. his wife gives me the tour of the house. it's designed by i.m. pei, filled with extremely expensive looking artifacts and artwork. basically as classy as you can imagine. like, seriously, designed by the one architect anyone not in r/architecture has ever heard of. i mention that i paint as a hobby. she asks to see my work. i pull out my phone. she leans over to see. i open photos. butt naked selfie with ""kelsey"" written in red lipstick on my chest.

780,Tamir,"this all began a few weeks ago.  so i'm good friends with my coworker and i have a weird sense of humor.  work bought lunch one day and there were a lot of mayo packets left over.  she hates mayo so everyday i saw her eating i would offer her some mayo.  this went on for a good week and on the following friday i thought it would be hilarious to wrap the mayo packet in a post it note with the phrase ""need mayo?"" written on it.
flash forward to two weeks ago.  she went to california to visit family.  drove down but was going to fly back up.  well needless to say she gets to the airport and was going through the security when the tsa pulled her aside.  ""ma'am do you have any liquids or things you'd like her to declare?"" they ask her.  to which she replied no.  the agents start digging through her purse and pull out said mayo packet.  apparently (as i was only informed about this) the dirty looks start from the agents but they allowed her to go through and she managed to catch her flight.  we are laughing about it now but yeah, if you want to stop someone from going through security just plant a mayo packet on them.",1.

781,Tamir,"this happened over a decade ago, when i was about 10. my family went on vacation and stayed for a few days with former neighbors, who moved frequently for the father's military job. i spent most of the time hanging out with their son who was about my age, but not terribly interesting.

we spent most of our time playing videogames on a tv in what i thought was an unused spare bedroom. one day i was awake early, so i sprinted full speed into the closed bedroom to hop on the psychonauts train early. i fling the door aside, and make it about 5 paces into the room before screeching to a halt.

boobs.

the wife of the military man had obviously just gotten out of a shower, which i had not noticed was connected to the bedroom via a small side door. she is a completely naked middle aged mother, and i have not even hit puberty and have never seen a woman naked before. we make eye contact. 

i backtrack as fast as humanly possible and slam the door, the cold grip of terror and confusion strangling my heart. i ate an absurdly uncomfortable breakfast 15 minutes later across from her. we never spoke again. i knock compulsively whenever entering rooms to this day.",2. Slightly guilty
786,Tamir,"this actually happened yesterday but, whatever, right.
so in my family of 4, mother, father, brother and myself, i am the only one that cooks for everyone. reason why? because i can literally cook anything normal. my dad cooks a bit of meat, and my mom some vegetables here and there, but for the most part i cook the most. 
so i wanted to try making some tilapia yesterday, and i figured that i could probably just fry it in a pan or some shit. all is going well, i manage to make 4 pieces of fried fish before my fu. i on the fifth or so fish cooking, i flour, egg, and bread it, and put it into the pan. i'm simultaneously watching tv, so i leave it there for some time while i go and watch the new episode of arrow and the flash. after about 5 minutes on low gas i come back to the kitchen and see that its not cooking. figuring its not hot enough, i turn on the gas all the way. i go back to tv and come back about 3 more minutes later. now its still not cooking and i don't know why but i figured whatever, im sure its fine. now i'm pretty stupid about this and stuff and was honestly more focused on the new episode of arrow and the flash than the food. after about 2 minutes, my mom comes bursting out of her room, yelling at me for god knows what. normally i would ignore these fits but this time i heard her yelling something about it smelling like gas. i think, what the fuck that cant be right. she goes into the kitchen, glances at the stove, and then i realize. the reason the fish wasn't cooking was the fire wasn't lit and it was just the gas filling the entire house. fuck fuck fuck fuck. i turn off the gas, open all the windows, and avoid fire for about 20 minutes as the gas evacuates the house. the entire time my mom was complaining to me that i could have burned down the house and stuff. well, good thing i didn't.",3. Moderately guilty
790,Tamir,"a bit of backstory: my eldest nephew, my parents' first grandchild, died very suddenly a month ago. he and i were very close, and he was only 6 months younger than me. my family have been crushed, obviously. we have a beautiful photo of him on our coffee table in the living room, which my mum and i use to talk to him. 

i live with my parents, and my mum and dad recently bought new couch cushions because our old ones were flat and uncomfortable. however, these new ones have these white, soft feathers in, which constantly poke through the fabric and stab you in the back. 

now i've taken a bit of a habit of pulling the fathers out whenever they poke me, and just placing them on the nearest flat surface. the seat beside me, on an empty plate, my fiance's leg, the dog's back, just anywhere that i can place them. 

today i pulled one out and placed it on the coffee table, and then went upstairs to play xbox. fast forward 20 minutes, and i can hear my mum crying. i go downstairs to comfort her, something that i've become accustomed to since my nephew died, and instead she looks kind of happy. i ask her what's up, and she beams at me with tears in her eyes and says ""oh, tashalou, there was this beautiful white feather right next to [my nephew's] photograph! he's still with us!""

i looked at the feather with wide eyes, and realised it was the feather that i'd pulled out of the cushion. my mum was holding it delicately, as if it were gold itself, when in reality it'd had been stabbing me in the arse less than 30 minutes before. 

i quickly explained that it was from the couch, for reasons i don't even understand myself, and my mum got upset, and stated in her bedroom all evening.",1. Not guilty
791,Tamir,"well, by ""today"" i actually mean ""several years ago when i was an immature 12 year old"".


so, back when i was 12, my family went camping with a few other families. the other kids on the camping trip were mostly guys around my age. however, there was this one family who brought their 7 year old daughter along.

while all of the parents were outside setting up the campfire and food, all of the kids were hanging out inside my cool tent trailer, including the 7 year old girl. being the asshole preteens we were, the other guys and i did this thing where we would make the little girl answer yes/no questions about things she wouldn't understand so that we could laugh at her. we would ask her things from ""are you a homo sapien?"" all the way to extreme stuff like ""do your parents support fascism?"". basically, depending on whether she said yes or no, we had a 50/50 shot of making her say something we could laugh at her for.

we did this for a short while, and then i had the brilliant idea of asking her this: ""are you a heterosexual?""

the girl was silent for about a second, and then she just suddenly started crying. loudly. the other guys and i had no idea what was going on, since none of the previous questions seemed to bother her that much (even if we were laughing at her).

the girl's dad recognized her daughter's crying, and immediately ran into the trailer, asking ""what happened!?""

the crying girl points at me, shouting ""jkrollingdown called me sexy!"". yep.

all the other guys started laughing their asses off. i almost soiled my pants.",4. Very guilty
801,Tamir,"this happened last month. while i was readying my bong for a hit, i receive a text from one of my cousins who says that they were having a wake in a chapel nearby, but i said fuck it, and smoked it before i went to the wake. so i go there all dressed up, with eyedrops with me just incase, when i am led by her to the casket, which just so happens to be open for viewing, when i just start giggling slightly, then it turns into almost a maniac laugh. when i realize how horrible this was, i just noped the fuck out of there. i get a call from my mom, asking wtf i just did, but me only beginning to become somber, said that i was going to eat somewhere and i remember just hanging up and not coming back afterwards. i haven't gotten in contact with them in quite a while, so i just wanted to share this story and maybe get a laugh or two.

after he was lowered into his grave people came by and gave us all hugs. one woman made a comment on how she liked that i wore red. about 10 minutes ago i googled it and found out that wearing red means you're glad the person is gone. so i effectively told all his friends and family that i was happy he died.

but that isn't the best part...
my gf pulls me to one side and tells me that the kid's family think she has severe adhd, but her they don't wanna get her tested/admit it because a) they're shit parents (sorry) and b) because they don't want her to be labelled at such a young age or something. head in hands time for me; i'm a dreadful human being. was fairly quiet for the rest of the day.",3.

here's where the story begins. the rocking boat, scorching sun, and cheap tequila hangover were bad enough; then about two hours in i get the urge to explosively shit my shorts. no bathroom. i didn't want to move, but i decided taking a good ole fashion aqua-deuce is better than shitting on the deck. i grab some goggles, get in the water and swim away from the group of people. i figure i'm a good distance away, dive down a little, pull my shorts down and let loose. this was some next level shit. there's shit floating all around me, and that`s when i realize that fish fucking love shit. tons of fish start pecking at it, and at this point some of the snorkelers are heading over since there's so many fish. i panic because i'm surrounded by my own feces so i just start wack-a-mole-ing the floating turds, trying to break them up. this causes more fish to come and more snorkelers as well. before i know it, i'm surrounded by fish and snorkelers... and we are all swimming in my shit. in the end i'm not sure if anyone noticed my shit floating around, but it was still embarrassing as hell.

821,Tamir,"so unlike most tifus this actually happened less than an hour ago. so i've just got back from watching the hunger games: mockingjay part 1 (just the title makes me yarl). the movie was 'ehh' but what happened next was class.
    the cinema is like a plaza and all the screens are above each other connected by two stairways. one goes to the reception via the entrance lady's bathroom and the other one via the men's, or so i thought.
    i mentioned to my family that i was going to the men's room as we left the screen. i nonchalantly walked down the stairs and i did my business, once finished i carried on walking downstairs to what i thought was the reception. i was acting too 'cool' to realise that i just walked through a double door labeled 'fire exit'.
    i was taken aback when i realised that this was not the reception and instead a small room with a big window door thing, with a label across it saying 'this door is alarmed at all times even when the cinema is open' 
    i then realised i fucked up and tried to turn back and leave to find that the door could only be opened from the inside. shit. i was locked in a room where one wall was just a window. to add insult to injury, everyone from the cinema could see me and my embarrassment. i quickly phoned my dad and pleaded him to save me.
    after 5 minutes of laughing at me through the window he finally agreed and made his way towards the mens room. (i later on found out he got lost and walked right through a screen showing 'my old lady')
    my guilt and sadness turned to excitement when the door next to me opened up and he stepped inside laughing at me. he was so preoccupied with laughing at me that he forgot to hold the door open and it closed on him too like a horrible, horrible trap. i will never forget his face when he realised that he too was locked in.

    after a good two minutes of knocking the door was finally opened and we rushed out to find a confused teenager holding it open.",1. Not guilty
823,Tamir,"actually happened today so hooray for acronym accuracy.

so, i'm back home with the family for summer break. i live on the other side of the country for school so communication between me and my parents has been sparse outside of occasional phone calls. naturally, they wanted to see how my college experience has been the past several months. having anticipated this, i was careful ahead of time to peruse through and remove any suspicious-looking thumbnails such as booze, partying, hookups, etc.

what i didn't catch was a picture of my toilet water i had taken after a (rather) painful dump and the toilet paper ran red upon wiping my delicate puckered orifice. normally, i would've just flushed and been done with it but i felt a strange non-diarrhetic sensation dripping out of my butthole and falling into the clear water below. i peered into the crapper and saw that blood had dripped into the toilet water such that it spread in a ring-like pattern in the likeness of a red watery tree trunk whirlpooling into the delicate petals of a flower born from a bloody colon. of course i had to take a picture of it. while photographing my ass art, i also ended up also taking a picture of my ballsack, which i later cropped out on my iphone. what i didn't know was that cropping on your phone does not actually crop the original image.

so, of course, as i display my journeys in college from hanging out with friends to eating exotic foods to my family, bam, there on the screen was a picture of my bloody ringed toilet water. normally, it would've been somewhat hard to tell what it was out of context, but my friggen ballsack was in the picture complete with some fuzziness in its uncropped glory. ensue awkwardness. family pretends nothing was there, but the elephant in the room had been birthed, almost as disgustingly as what was on my screen.

825,Tamir,"i have three cats, two are litter mates, a male (max) and a female (maya), and a third female kitten (stella). 

maya took a fondness to hair ties  after a few months and chased after them when we shot them. not long after that she realized we would shoot them again if she brought them back. we were  stoked! i'd personality never owned cats, let alone played fetch with a cat, so thought it was awesome at first.

 this quickly escalated to an obsession for maya, she would hunt and retrieve  forever if you let her,  i once did it for 7 hours straight!  she began having withdrawals as we scaled back the hair tie game. she brought hair ties to us everytime we came home,  and eventually started perching next to us at night with a hair tie set beside us. she would stare indefinitely through the night, lightly tapping on our faces to pay attention to her and play some fucking hair tie. 

enter stella. stella is a new addition to the family and she is a really dumb cat with crossed eyes, and a beautiful coat. she and maya immediately take to each other and sure enough they become cat bros  (sis'?). 

stella watched and learned from maya, and eventually became attached to a particular orange fuzzy cat toy. she runs around with it in her mouth like a dog,  hides it, sleeps with it, furiously attacks and rolls around with it... but then she began mimicking maya by playing fetch,  and we were naive enough to play along  (it was/is still pretty fuckin cute).

flash forward to last night in which they both perched over my fiance and i all fucking night. they just sat there silently staring at us, poking our faces with their little bean toe pads, purring in disapproving tones. it got creepy so i kicked them out of the room,  at which point they proceeded to attack the carpet at the threshold of the door until i got up and got them to stop. they immediately picked up their respective fetch toys in their mouth and looked up at me patiently.  

i have created annoying fetch monsters.

max gives zero fucks about all of this nonsense and just wants to be a fat doughy cuddle cat bro.

828,Tamir,"so i live with my family currently, so i have to partake in family things... the night before i had been out, lots of ale, jager and not alot of food. 

so i'm sat downstairs and my little sister is excited as hell, opening her eggs... but then it happens...

a rumble of the likes i've never felt before and then this urge to fart, all of a sudden the loudest, wettest thing you have ever heard erupted from my anus. i instantly knew...

i had shat myself.

yep, so i just look everyone dead in the eyes and say only what i can think of saying ""i appear to have crapped myself"" and i proceed to walk upstairs like john wayne and have a shower.",1. Not guilty
833,Tamir,"my wife has always wanted a bloodhound and i found a breeder a few hours away. i contacted her, had some fantastic conversations from the day their dog conceived, throughout the pregnancy and to the day the pups were born. i told her i wanted a boy and my wife and i started planning on a kennel and how we would introduce him to the dogs and cats we already have. we even named him! 

my wife kept saying ""if we get the puppy..."" and i told her that we would absolutely get the puppy.. they knew how much we wanted it... the breeder was almost a friend of the family at this point for crying out loud! 

yesterday i got a text saying that she hasn't recieved the deposit and if we still wanted a puppy. i had just woken up after fighting a migraine all day and was barely coherent but told her absolutely we wanted the dog and i would transfer the money. this morning e-transfered the deposit at 10am.

a half hour ago (just before midnight) i was informed that i could cancel the transfer because she placed the last dog at 830am.

i'm out of town, so not only am i going to have to tell my wife that we lost her puppy, but i'm going to have to do it over the phone since i won't be home till thursday or friday. i can't even hug her when she starts to cry...",3. Moderately guilty
835,Tamir,"well this happened just a few minutes ago, i was already on reddit and thought ""hey why not?"". 

 my dad was sitting on the couch eating soup or cereal or something, i'm not sure, while he, my sister, and i were all watching a movie. suddenly he sort of sputter/coughs an wheezes a little. i asked if he was okay and he answered with another solid cough. at this poit i thought he was just dealing with the typical ""went down the wrong pipe *cough cough* but it's cool now"" scenario. i laughed a little half heartedly, thinking he would follow with ""hate when that happens"" or something similar. instead, he continued to sputter and wheeze for another second or two, finally got down the bit of food, and with his first breath exclaimed "" what the fuck, mywarpaintissharpie!?! i'm choking and you laugh at me?!?""

i tried to explain and apologize, but he just shook his head and walked off, muttering something about me being ""fucked in the head"". my sister also chimed in, agreeing about how shitty of a person i am. now i'm pretty positive my whole family thinks i'm some kind of sadist.",3. Moderately guilty
837,Tamir,"so this happened last year. 

it was 8pm and i was talking with my very naughty girl friend via whatsapp, and we started discussing about porn and some dirty stuff. 

i was also browsing facebook, and i saw a certain link somewhere to send her to provoke. 

and then i go to the fb messenger on the browser, type her name , the message and then enter. but it happens that her first name is the same as my aunt's. i go back to whatsapp and said : ""did you like the link i sent you ?"" her : ""what link ?""

my heart stopped. 

i sent this message to my aunt : "" build you own dildo now, with a 3d printer. --- hahaha i think you'll like this, try building a 40cm(*15 inches*)  black dildo for you "".
 
she has 3 kids and a husband. about 40 years old. 

never seen her anymore in family reunions.",3. Moderately guilty
843,Tamir,"i've been drinking. let's just get that out of the way first.

this happened about 3 hours ago.

i was at my local brewpub, and had just finished using the bathroom. after i've had a few, i'm a little bit absent minded, so i always give that flap on the front of my pants a tug to make sure i remembered to zip my fly. quite often i do this after i've left the bathroom. you see where this is going.

i did not wear underwear today. as i'm walking back to my table, i do my spot check in-transit, and end up flopping out lil' kevinnnnnn right into the faces of a lovely family of five. they were not pleased. i immediately walked out the door and cabbed home.",4. Very guilty
844,Tamir,"this actually happened a few weeks ago on the 24th of june, but i only recalled it and decided to post it now. 

i have a facebook account (for obvious reasons won't tell), which was set by my parents when i was 12. when i turned 14 i started using the account just to add friends and like photos/comments, so i hardly knew anything about my personal profile on facebook.

back to the fu: i jigged school on my birthday (yes i'm bad), because both my legs were cramped from squad swimming the previous day. so i stayed home, gamed, studied for end of term exams and stoned in bed, or at least i would've if i didn't have 200 indian relatives who i had to thank for calling every 2 minutes. 

i answered the phone and most people just said ""happy birthday!"", ""wish you a good year!"" and ""how're your studies going?""<-classic indian question. i respond normally with a pre-set response for the last one, when i think i notice some of the callers shaking the phone which is weird since i knew it was summer in india. 

as the list continued to decrease, closer relatives and family friends began to call and one of them says ""happy birthday avalansh8!"" ""how does it feel being forty?"" confused, i thought she was talking about my ""maturity"" and so i played along, saying yeah all good, hard at work, etc. 

the next day all my friends are questioning why i jigged and wishing me (in that order of course), and jokingly asked why i was still in the school. still not getting the reference, thinking they were calling me smart i said, ""looking after you scrubs!"" 

when i got home, i decided to go on facebook since i knew i'd delayed the inevitable and had to maintain friendships by responding to the bottomless list of birthday wishes and private messages t-t . i asked my best friend why my relatives and friends were calling me 40. he said check your profile.

so i look at my personal profile and see my birthday: 24/06/1975. my parents had swapped in their year of birth since i wasn't old enough to enter facebook at the time, and since i'm linked to nearly everyone in the school, everyone saw it.",2. Slightly guilty
848,Tamir,"a little backstory: it was the summer and i had decided to drink 2 pepsi's before this had happened. i was hyper and couldn't calm down.

the fu: i was eating dinner with my family and i got the most ingenious idea. how about gliding with a thick blanket off my small couch? it could've worked, right? it didn't. i was prepping to do it and jumped off. gravity decided to be a bitch to me and let me fall instead of gliding. my nose hurt (and still does to this day) and the front of my body did too. i woke up the next morning with a sore nose on the right side (which still hurts to this day) and felt my nose. i realized i had a deviated septum because of the fall. i panicked but the pain went away when i put bengay on it.",2. Slightly guilty
858,Tamir,"so recently my family got a new laptop running windows 8. me being the poor fuck i am currently use my parents computer to do my school work and such. i like most horny teenage boys, like to drain the dragon after a rough day at school. here's where it gets interesting. well one day doin the usual thing and get to jackin the beanstalk when i  notice the new camera app on the computer. curious as i was, i clicked on it. stupid. before i closed it, i accidentally took a picture,  but deleted it right away. and then proceeded to finish the job off and forget about it.  flash foward to today.  easter sunday. after all our extended family went home, i went to a friends for a bonfire. around 11pm, i come home and my mom is on the computer fucking around playing candy crush or some shit. as i start talking to her she shows me the metro view (or whatever the fuck the app page is called). right on the picture app is me. holding my raging boner. i was wearing a bright orange shirt and even though there was no face it was undeniably me. now if that wasnt enough to explain to my mom, i had to convince her that i was indeed not having cybersex with anyone. i also had to explain that you do not have to pay for porn on the internet. fml.",3. Moderately guilty
865,Tamir,"didn't happen today, but a 3-4 years ago.
i was visiting my mom's brother and his family in india (i was about 12 years old or so). i lived in another country (not india). anyways, i stayed with them for about 2 weeks by myself (parents were coming to another city in india later), so i pretty much spent time with my cousins, uncle, aunt and grandma. 
one day, my uncle decided to take me down to the beach to show me what it was like. so my uncle, cousin and i set out. we left home and walked to the car (it was parked further up a street). it was like 2 pm and there was a lot of traffic on the street. there were 2 trucks blocking our path ahead to the car, which was just in front of these trucks, and there were only 2 ways to get past these trucks - go in between them, or squeeze in between a wall and the truck. my cousin and uncle go between the trucks, but the overly safety-conscious me decides to squeeze in between the wall and the truck. bad idea. i get through no problem, but i notice something as i reach out to open the car door - there were hundreds of black ants on my left arm. i kid you not, hundreds. my arm was literally black, from wrist to shoulder, and was barely able to see any of my skin. and these weren't just any black ants, they were carpenter ants. i must've brushed past an ant colony, and given them a new home. i frantically started brushing them off, at which point they started biting. i flinched in pain as they kept on biting me. my uncle and cousin, noticing my discomfort, rushed to my aid, and upon seeing my situation, started laughing hysterically before helping me out (they were still laughing then). there were still a few ants on me after we brushed them all off, having spread out to some uncomfortable places. we still went to the beach though, where i rinsed myself thoroughly before taking a shower back home.

 

sorry for any grammatical errors by the way, ib has left me sleep deprived for a week",2. Slightly guilty
872,Tamir,"background: i'm an actor and am currently assistant directing/assistant stage managing a production at a community theater that opens on friday the 17th. my responsibilities with this big production include an on-stage part, as well as work with a djembe throughout the production.

on the other hand, i asked a girl to my senior prom a couple weeks ago. today i bought the tickets, which totaled to $220. that's a pretty hefty commitment, yeah?

so now i realize that both of these (basically) mandatory events are happening on the same night at the same time. given that the director of the stage production doesn't even think performing at benaroya hall (in seattle) is a good enough reason to miss one rehearsal...i think i'm pretty solidly fucked here.

i have an idea for a plan to get replacements for the stage production, as i pretty much can't just cancel the prom (due to my commitment to my date, not to mention the financial involvement, which is hefty for my family).

 

update: i'm going to miss the show for that one night so that i can go to my prom. but my director isn't happy, of course, and i have to find replacements. i hate to upset them at the theater, but i've done a considerable amount of charitable work for their benefit.",4. Very guilty
876,Tamir,"before i share my story, i'd like to say that this didn't happen today.


so my aunt, who lives outside the city, visits the whole family every once in a while. she has this adorable son, who's 3 years old, just like my sister, let's call him m. anyways, both of them wanted to play outside, so my dad went with them. so after almost an hour of couch surfing and browsing, i decided to finally show myself and do something with my cute little cousin, so i went outside and just tried to enjoy the weather, talk, kick a ball around, just anything to entertain myself. then m comes by and tries to tell me something, he's pointing at a basketball, then points at the net. so i tell myself ""oh no biggie nothing will happen, he probably knows how to hold a ball"" and proceed to lift m and let him sit on my shoulders after he picked up the basketball from the hard concrete flooring of our backyard.

he looks down and says ""now?"", and i tell him ""yeah go ahead!"". for some reason i'm only (barely) holding his legs. as soon as he attempts to lift the ball he loses balance and falls head first on the ground. fuck. shit. what the fuck do i do now!!??? before i even make sense of the situation my whole family is running up to m, who is obviously crying, shrieking and screaming, and i'm getting told off and shouted at by about 4 people at the same time. after calming down, i went up to m to apologize and he has a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head. thank god his mother wasn't there at the time.",2. Slightly guilty
879,Tamir,"hey reddit! this happened on sunday. 

so there i was, half in the bag at my best friend's engagement and housewarming party. family and friends were gathered all around his well decorated new living room. everyone is having a delightful time. the room is buzzing with side conversations, light music is playing in the back ground, his new fiance is cooking some small appetizers with the other ladies and the guys are all drinking beer and chit-chatting about finishing the basement, how nice the driveway is and how great he (best friend) is doing. 

my girlfriend (my shy, very intelligent, beautiful girlfriend) is sitting in between two of the oldest friends of the couple's family. i sit next to her and gently place my hand on her thigh to let her know that i'm there. she smiles and whispers to me, asking for a bottle of water. i return quickly in my idiotic stupor and hand it to her like a good dog. she, given her sense of humor, eye-balls be from the side and dramatically throws her head back as if to take a long, slow drink of this sweet nectar of the gods. 

when out of nowhere i squeeze the water bottle, ramming +8oz of water down her throat.

immediately i see her eyes get huge and she begins to choke, spitting water all over her new pants, sweater, floor and almost throwing up on the family friends while i run around the kitchen looking for paper towels. 

i apologized immediately after, wondering why the hell it seemed so funny in my head, while she laughed and cried hysterically. (yes, she thought it was hilarious.) the only other people who thought it was a riot was my brother, best friend and his fiance. 

everyone else was baffled by ""how much of an asshole that i am,"" and proceeded to spend the rest of the evening giving me dirty looks, making snarky comments like *""if you don't want to ride home with him, you don't have to""* and the like.",5. Completely guilty
882,Tamir,"so yesterday on my way to class i ran into a friend that i made last year. i asked her how she was doing and she said she was actually directing a production of chicago at our university theatre. i got excited and told her i'd go after i got out of class. 

so i went to the play, enjoyed the whole thing, and went on my way out. as i walked through the exit door i saw her standing outside with her family and i ran over to give her a hug and tell her she did a great job. unfortunately, the play bill was in my hand and when i reached my arm around her the corner of it flew into her eye. she didn't think much of it first, just said ""ow"" and rubbed it for a minute. 

today i wake up and check snapchat to see a picture of her with a bandage over her eye saying ""u put a program in my eye u fool.""",2. Slightly guilty
885,Tamir,"t(8 months ago) ifu at a ski resort in canada, me and my family had been staying there for about five days, and i've been doing a black diamond with moguls over the past few days while the rest of my family went down a different way.

me being the speed demon i am i rocket down the hill, at the bottom there was a path to the left and one to the right, in the middle was a cluster of trees, at first i was going to the left but at the last second i tried to turn right, this part is the fu. i hit a chunk of ice and go flying into the trees, shooting my poles in front of me to absorb some of the shock, flipped about 5 ft into the air and land square on my back on top of a branch. i black out for like a minute and wake up upside down blood streaming from a hash in my cheek. goggles cracked. eventually some dude found me and took me to the medic luckily i had no broken bones, but i was left with a scar.",3.

886,Tamir,"this happened a couple of hours ago. i was at my mother's friends party, i didn't know one person there so after a couple of hours i stood in a corner and started browsing reddit. little did i know i was standing right in front of a mirror for the whole party to see what phone displayed. i was browsing /r/gonewild when i started seeing some dirty looks from some of the attendees i was flabbergasted as to what they were for until i realised the mirror behind me. i quickly turned off my phone but it was too late... half the party was glaring at me and my family was forced to leave early in shame.",3.

889,Tamir,"tifu - so since monday jan, 11 i was thinking of a plan to make a move on this girl in my grade. (7th grade) i'm up about two hours a night thinking, "" oh damn this plan is going to be fire. i'm gonna get my dick sucked and shits gonna go down "". the plan was to make a quick hop in and smooch her lips, everything went better in my head, as it always does for everyone. now i'd wake up, smell good, look snazzy, get to school like ""this is it!"". i walk up to the girl about to engage and nope can't do it so i turn right around and think about my fucked up self and why i can't do it. 

this happens every day until thursday jan, 14. i've gotten up, done the same shit, and i'm sitting in facs class 2nd hour. ( family and consumer science) - (i think) i'm telling my friends about the master plan to steal her heart and be a boss. that's when i decided ""fuck it whats the worst that could happen?"". 2nd hour ends. . . my whole squads grouping up behind me and i walk up to her, look her in the big beautiful brown eyes, put my arm around her, close my eyes, pucker up my sexy lips, and then she just does a 180 and speed walks away. i didn't even realize nearly half of my grade was watching it unravel. just to put it in perspective my class is about 250 kids. today. . . i fucked up.",
892,Tamir,"so this actually happened a few days ago i just found out today. i had used my families 1.3tb hard drive to get an xbox fallout save on it because there is no new game plus feature. so i configured it and went on my merry way. about 3 days later my computer becomes so slow a german heavy tank could drive from berlin to paris and be faster than this piece of shit. so i decided to back up my stuff and re-install fresh. i open the drive from computer and delete the xbox360 folder and wait for everything to re-appear as this had worked before. nothing happens. i go fucking apeshit on this. this has backups from everybody in my house and other people in my family. it had a full backup of my grandmas computer which took my dad a full 4-5 hours to do. it had my entire steam library on it. and worst of all it had family photos on it. i downloaded recuva, ntfs undeleter, and test disk. recuva got 15k files but ignored 16k files. i need a full recovery of this drive to take my ass off the surface of the sun.",3. Moderately guilty
899,Tamir,"preface: i was maybe 7 years old at the time. what is the expiry for these? eh, i'm fine.

my family were travelers when i was a kid; we'd have a big trip maybe every one or two years, and would do some shorter road-trips in between. due to the fact that me and my sibling were, 1. children stuck in a car, and 2. big readers, my parents used to rent and play books on tape during long drives. 

the tapes we usually rented were pretty tame, maybe some harry potter or similar fiction novels. i can't for the life remember what this book was, but am assuming it was some sort of historic fiction. of course with this came some themes that my 7-year old brain wasn't able to handle, or contextualize, or understand, and vocab to follow suit. 

at some point the reader said the n word, and repeated it in dialogue. i can only assume my parents froze up, since they weren't the type of folks to talk about anything remotely 'heavy'. i asked them what it meant. no one answered. i asked them again, probably louder. still, no one answered. after asking three or four times what the word meant, and having no one answer me, i *clearly* remember chanting it, calling my very white suburban parents it, and laughing as no one else said a word. my sibling turned to me and told me to stop saying it, so i did. 

still no one told me what it meant, and i'm certain i tried to use it in everyday conversation because i was a stuck up know-it-all kid. sigh.",1. Not guilty
